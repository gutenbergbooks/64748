</div>


<p>The appearance, a few months ago, of <span class="smcap">The Analysis of Religious
Belief</span> caused not a little excitement in England, and its
introduction into our country had much the same effect here.
While many were more or less shocked by the Viscount's
boldness of language in examining the sources of the religious
creeds of the world, and at the freedom with which he removed
the sacred mask from many antique myths and superstitions,
the thoughtful and the enquiring were furnished with a fund
of material for new thought, and largely-increased facilities for
investigating and comparing the creeds and dogmas which have
made up the ruling religious faiths of mankind.</p>

<p>When the Viscount's high birth is remembered; that he was
the son of Lord John Russell, one of the first and oldest Peers
of England; that he was thus closely connected with the aristocracy
of that country; that he had been carefully nurtured
within the fold of the Christian Church; that he had received
the instruction of a pious Christian mother, from the days of
his early childhood, that the influence of his parents and his
early companions was to draw him under the control of
the popular system of religion which rules in his country, it is
not a little remarkable that he had the independence and moral
bravery to come out in opposition to all his near friends, and to
avow his unbelief in a code of ethics and opinions unlike those
taught him in his childhood and youth, an unusual interest
attaches to the work which he produced.</p>

<p>When it is borne in mind that his amiable and sympathetic
wife toiled with him and rendered him essential service in collecting
and arranging the matter for his two volumes; that she
was taken from him by the hand of death before his work was
completed; that he also sank under the hand of disease and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv"> iv</span>
passed away while his work was still in the hands of the
printer, it is indeed invested with peculiar interest.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that after his death urgent efforts
were made—and from high sources too—to suppress his work;
that the powerful Duke of Bedford, backed by Lord John Russell
himself, tried to buy up the entire edition issued; it is enough
to make every sympathetic and enquiring person anxious to read
the results of his labor of years.</p>

<p>If some of the advanced thinkers of the day find that Viscount
Amberly—as evinced in some of the later chapters of this
volume—had not in all respects evolved in the line of Free-thought
so far as they have done they should remember that he
had at least made rapid progress for the time he had devoted
to the pursuit of truth. He was still a young man at the time
of his death, and had it been his lot to have scored a greater
number of years, with the advantage of the experience which
they give, it is very possible his views might have undergone
other modifications.</p>

<p>The London edition was issued in two volumes, 8vo and
was necessarily sold at a large price. This American edition
contains the entire work in one volume and is presented to the
public at about one-fifth the price at which the English edition
was sold. It is hoped this feature will be duly appreciated by
the American public.</p>

</div>


<p>Ere the pages now given to the public had left the press, the
hand that had written them was cold, the heart—of which few
could know the loving depth—had ceased to beat, the far-ranging
mind was forever still, the fervent spirit was at rest.</p>

<p>Let this be remembered by those who read, and add solemnity
to the solemn purpose of the book.</p>

<p>May those who find in it their most cherished beliefs questioned
or contemned, their surest consolations set at naught,
remember that he had not shrunk from pain and anguish to
himself, as one by one he parted with portions of that faith
which in boyhood and early youth had been the mainspring of
his life.</p>

<p>Let them remember that, however many the years granted
to him on earth might have been, his search after truth would
have ended only with his existence; that he would have been
the first to call for unsparing examination of his own opinions,
arguments, and conclusions; the first to welcome any new lights
thrown by other workers in the same field on the mysteries of
our being and of the universe.</p>

<p>Let them remember that while he assails much which they
reckon unassailable, he does so in what to him is the cause of
goodness, nobleness, love, truth, and of the mental progress of
mankind.</p>

<p>Let them remember that the utterance of that which, after
earnest and laborious thought he deemed to be the truth, was
to him a sacred duty; and may they feel, as he would have felt,
the justness of these words of a good man and unswerving
Christian lately passed away: "A man's charity to those who
differ from him upon great and difficult questions will be in the
ratio of his own knowledge of them: the more knowledge, the
more charity."</p>

<p><i>With all reverence and all affection, to the memory of the ever-lamented
wife whose hearty interest in this book was, during many years of preparatory
toil, my best support; whose judgment as to its merits or its
faults would have been my most trusted guide; whose sympathy my
truest encouragement; whose joyous welcome of the completed work I
had long looked forward to as my one great reward: whose nature,
combining in rare union scientific dearness with spiritual depth, may
in some slight degree have left its impress on the page, though far too
faintly to convey an adequate conception of one whose religious zeal in
the cause of truth was rivaled only by the ardor of her humanity
and the abundance of her love.</i></p>

<p class="half-title">AN ANALYSIS OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GENERAL_INTRODUCTION"><i>GENERAL INTRODUCTION.</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Human nature, among all the phenomena it offers to the
curious inquiries of the student, presents none of more transcendent
interest than the phenomenon of Religion. Pervading
the whole history of mankind from the very earliest ages of
which we have any authentic knowledge up to the present day;
exercising on the wild and wandering tribes, which seem to
have divided the earth among them in those primitive times,
an influence scarcely less profound than it has ever exercised on
the most polite and cultivated nations of the modern world;
leading now to peace and now to war; now to the firmest of
alliances, now to the bitterest enmities; uniting some in the
bonds of a love so enduring as to outlast and put to shame the
fleeting unions of earthly passion; separating others, even when
every motive of interest and natural affection conspired to unite
them, so completely as to impel them to deliver each other up
to the ghastliest tortures; Religion deserves a foremost place—if
not the foremost place of all—among the emotions which
have in their several ways affected, modified, and controlled the
current of human events.</p>

<p>Forming, as it does, so large an element in the constitution
of our complex nature; and playing so vast a part in guiding
our actions, Religion must well deserve to be made the subject
of philosophical inquiry. If we can by any scientific means discover
its origin, lay bare its true character to the gaze of students,
and estimate the value of its pretensions to be in posses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20"> 20</span>sion
of truths of equal, if not superior, authority to those of
either natural or moral science, we shall have performed a task
which may not be wholly useless or altogether uninstructive.</p>

<p>Our first business, in such an inquiry as this, should be to
determine the method on which it ought to be conducted. In
analyzing the religious systems of the world, the question of
method is all-important. Indeed, it will be abundantly evident
in the course of the ensuing investigations that the conclusions
reached by those who have cultivated this field of knowledge
have often been unsound, simply because they have failed to
pursue the only proper method. Nothing can be easier, for
instance, than to construct elaborate systems of religious philosophy,
the several parts of which hang so well together that
we find it; difficult to urge any solid objection against them,
while yet the whole edifice rests upon so insecure a foundation
that at the least touch of its lowest stones it will fall in ruins
to the ground. This too common mistake arises from the fact
that the first principles of the system are assumed without adequate
warrant, and will not bear examination. Half, if not
many more than half, the common errors of believers in the
various current creeds are due to a similar cause. These persons
start from some principle which they conceive to be indisputable,
and proceed to draw inferences from it with the most
complete confidence. An extreme instance of this is mentioned
by Dr. Sprenger, who was asked by a Musselman how he could
disbelieve the religion of Islam, seeing that Mahomet's name
was written on the gates of paradise. In a less palpable form,
the same mode of reasoning is constantly adopted among ourselves.
Either we do not take the trouble to submit the evidence
of the facts upon which we erect our arguments to a
sufficiently rigorous scrutiny, or we fail to perceive that the
axioms we take for granted are in reality neither self-evident,
as our system requires, nor capable of any satisfactory demonstration.</p>

<p>Another and perhaps scarcely a less common kind of error
arising from defective method is a failure to distinguish between
adequate and inadequate evidence of religious truth. A sound
and exhaustive method would not fail to disclose, if not what
kind of evidence is sufficient, at least what kind of evidence is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21"> 21</span>
insufficient, to prove our doctrines. It is plain that if we
should find arguments of the same character used by the adherents
of different creeds to prove contradictory propositions, we
should be forced to dismiss such arguments as of comparatively
little value. Supposing, for example, that a Hebrew, desirous of
proving the preëminence of the Jews over the Gentiles,
should rely for his justification on the miraculous deliverance
of the ancient Israelites from the Egyptians, and on their
subsequent special protection by the Deity, his argument, however
apparently conclusive, would be considerably weakened if
it were found that the annals of other nations contained similar
tales evincing a similar exclusive care for their welfare on
the part of their local divinities. Or if we should claim for our
own school the advantage of being supported by the authority
of a long succession of able, wise, and virtuous men, fully competent
to judge of its truth, yet if our adversaries can produce
an equally imposing list of authorities against us, we shall have
gained but little by our mode of reasoning. These one-sided
ways of proving the exclusive claims of a particular creed are
as if a person should maintain the vast superiority of his countrymen
over foreigners by a reference to the battles they had
won, the territory they had conquered, and the bravery they
had displayed; forgetful to inquire whether there were not
other nations which had gained victories equally transcendent,
made conquests equally extensive, and evinced a heroism
equally admirable.</p>

<p>These blunders, it may be objected, do not arise exclusively
from a faulty method. It is true that they have a deeper
source, yet, if a correct method were pursued they would be
avoided. Hence the paramount importance of fixing upon one
which shall not be likely to lead us astray.</p>

<p>Now, the method which in the natural sciences, and in the
science of language, has led to such vast results, may be, and
ought to be pursued here. This method is that of comparison.</p>

<p>When the philologist is desirous of discovering what elements,
if any, a group of languages possesses in common, and
what therefore may be considered as its fundamental stock, or
essence, he compares them with one another. When the naturalist
wishes to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the confor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22"> 22</span>mation,
habits, or character of any class of animals, he can
only do so by a comparison of different members of that class.
How misleading our conclusions frequently are in matters like
these when they are not based upon a sufficiently wide comparison,
will be familiar to all. And though the analogy between
these sciences and religion is far from precise, yet no good reason
can be assigned why a method, which has been so successful
in one case, should be totally neglected in the latter. Nor
is it enough to say that this method is capable of application
to the subject in hand. Religion, owing to certain characteristics
which will now be explained, lends itself with peculiar
facility to an inquiry thus conducted.</p>

<p>A merely superficial and passing glance at the phenomena
presented to us by the history and actual condition of the
world brings clearly to light two facts:</p>

<p>1. The absolute, or all but absolute universality of some kind
of religious perception or religious feeling.</p>

<p>2. The countless variety of forms under which that feeling
has made its appearance.</p>

<p>History and the works of travelers, amply prove that no considerable
nation has ever been without religion, and that if it
has ever been wanting, it has only been among the rudest savages,
whose mental and moral condition was too low to be capable
of any but the most obvious impressions of sense. Equally
indubitable is the second proposition. We are acquainted with
no period in which each country did not possess its own special
variety of religious doctrine; we are acquainted with none in
which there were not many and wide divergences within the
bosom of each country among individuals, among sects, and
among churches.</p>

<p>In this universality of a certain sentiment, accompanied by
this variety of modes, we have at least a possible distinction
between the Substance and the Form, between the universal
emotion known as Religion, and the local or temporary coloring
it may happen to assume.</p>

<p>It will be convenient if we call the substance by the name of
<span class="smcap">Faith</span>, and the form by that of <span class="smcap">Belief</span>. The use of these terms
in these senses is no doubt slightly arbitrary, yet the shade of
difference in their ordinary meaning is sufficient to justify it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23"> 23</span>
Faith is a term of large and general signification, referring
rather to the feelings than the reason; whereas Belief generally
implies the intellectual adoption of some definite proposition,
capable of distinct statement in words.</p>

<p>The importance of the comparative method in the process of
sifting, classifying, and ordering the elements of these respective
spheres will now be apparent. For it is only by a comparison
of the varieties of Belief that we can hope to arrive at an
acquaintance with Faith. Setting one system beside another,
carefully observing wherein they differ and wherein they agree,
we may at length hope to discover what elements, if any, are to
be set down to the account of Faith, and what other elements
to that of Belief. Even after a full comparison there will still
be considerable danger that we may mistake tenets which are
widely held, but not universal, for primordial conceptions of
the human mind. Without such a comparison, we should most
undoubtedly do so, for we are ever unwilling to recognize how
wide are the limits of variation of which the opinions and sentiments
of men are capable.</p>

<p>Should we, however, succeed in eliminating by our analysis
all that is local, and all that is temporary, we shall possess, in
what remains to us after this process, a universal truth of
human nature. Observe that I speak here of a truth of human
nature as distinguished from a truth of external nature. The
one does not of necessity imply the other, for it is conceivable
that men might universally entertain certain hopes, fears, aspirations,
or convictions which were wholly groundless; the supposed
objects of which had no existence whatever beyond the
mind that entertained them. In the present case, then, all that
the most exhaustive comparison could do would be to lead us
up to the scientific fact, that there is in human beings an irresistible
tendency towards certain sentiments of a spiritual kind.
Whether those sentiments can be the foundation of any rational
conviction it is unable to tell us.</p>

<p>This question, however, is fully as important as the other,
and I do not propose to pass it over in silence. It will be one
object of our investigation to discover how far we are entitled
to treat truths of human nature as identical with objective
truths. If we are obliged to confess that no inference can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24"> 24</span>
drawn from the one to the other, then it will be plain that
Faith, however profoundly implanted in our hearts, does not
convey to us any assurance of a single religious truth; for the
impressions which we call our Faith may be as purely illusory
as the fancies of delirium, or the images of our dreams. If, on
the other hand, an internal sentiment may be accepted, not so
much as a basis for truth, but as itself true; as leading, and
not misleading us; then we must further examine what are the
truths which are in a manner contained in Faith, and of which
Faith is the warrant.</p>

<p>The first Book, therefore, will deal mainly with Belief. Its
object will be, by a comparison of some of the various creeds
that are, or have been, accepted by men, to discover the general
characteristics of Belief, and to separate these from the
more special and distinctive elements peculiar to given times,
districts, and races. These general characteristics will, however,
belong exclusively to the region of Belief, and not to that of
Faith. In other words, they will have no title to a place in a
Universal Religion.</p>

<p>In the second Book we shall proceed to investigate the
nature of Faith. We shall endeavor to lay bare the foundation
of the vast superstructure of Theology and Ritual erected by
the piety of the human race. We shall seek to discover, if that
be possible, the element of unity amid so much variety, of permanence
amid so much change. And should we be successful
in the search, we shall be in a position, if not absolutely to
solve, at least to attempt the solution of the great problem
which ever has interested, and ever must interest mankind: Is
there any such thing as positive truth in the sphere of Religion?
And if so, what is it? Or are the human faculties strictly
limited to that species of knowledge which is acquired through
the medium of the senses, and doomed, in all spiritual things,
to be the victims of endless longings for which there is no
satisfaction, and of perpetual questionings to which there is no
response?</p>

</div>


<p>Religious Feeling, like all other human emotions, makes
itself objectively known to us by its manifestations. With its
subjective character we are not concerned, our business in the
present book being to treat it merely as an objective phenomenon.
Thus regarded, its manifestations appear extremely various,
but on closer examination they will be found to spring from
a common principle. This principle is the desire felt by the
human race in general to establish a relationship between itself
and those superhuman or supernatural powers upon whose will
it supposes the course of nature and the well-being of men to
be dependent. Were it not for this desire, the Religious Idea—if
I may venture by this term to denominate the original sentiment
which is the beginning of positive religion—might remain
locked up for ever in the breast of each individual who felt it.
But there is innate in human beings—arriving like wanderers
in the midst of a world they cannot understand—an overpowering
wish to enter into some sort of communication with the
mysterious agencies of whose extraordinary force they are continually
conscious, but which appear to be hidden from their
observation in impenetrable darkness.</p>

<p>Any man who seems able to give information as to the nature
of these agencies; who can declare their wishes with regard
to the conduct of men; who can assert, with apparent authority,
their determination to reward certain kinds of actions, and to
punish others, is listened to with avidity; and if he is believed
to speak truly his counsels are followed. Any tradition which
is held to make known the proper manner of approaching these
great powers is devoutly conserved, and becomes the foundation
of the conduct of many generations. Any writing which is consecrated
by popular belief as either emanating directly from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28"> 28</span>
these powers, or as having been composed under their authority
and at their dictation, is regarded with profound reverence;
and no one is allowed to question either its statements of fact
or its injunctions. What are the particular characteristics which
enable either men, traditions, or writings to acquire so extraordinary
an authority, it is difficult, if not impossible, to say.
Some approach to a reply may be made in the course of the
inquiry, but much will still remain unaccounted for: one of
those ultimate secrets of our nature which admit of no complete
discovery. Certain it is, however, that this passionate
longing to enter into some kind of relation with the unknown
receives its satisfaction in the earliest stages of human society.</p>

<p>Man, isolated, fearful, struck with wonder at his own existence,
craves to become acquainted with the Divine will, to hear
the accents of the Divine voice, to offer up his petitions to those
higher beings who are able to grant them, and to offer them up
in such a manner that they may be willing as well as able. Impelled
by this craving, the Religious Idea passes out of its condition
of vague emotion into that of positive opinion. It becomes
manifest, or, if I may use an appropriate image, incarnate.</p>

<p>The means by which the wished-for intercourse between man
and the higher powers is effected are obviously twofold: such
as convey information from the worshipers to their deities, and
such as convey it from the deities back to their worshipers. In
other words they might be described as serving for communication
upwards, or communication downwards; from mankind to
God, or from God to mankind. In the former case human beings
are the agents; in the latter the patients. In the former,
they consciously and intentionally place themselves, or endeavor
to place themselves, in correspondence with the unseen powers;
in the latter, they simply receive the injunctions, reproofs, or
other intimations with which those powers may think fit to
favor them.</p>

<p>The methods by which this correspondence is sought to be
effected are very various. Let us take first those which carry
the thoughts of men's hearts upwards.</p>

<p>1. The earliest, simplest, and most universal method is the
performance of certain solemnities of a regularly recurrent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29"> 29</span>
kind, which, as expressive of their object, I will term <i>consecrated
actions</i>. Such actions are prayer, praise, sacrifice, ceremonies
and rites, offerings, and, in short, all the numerous external
acts comprehended under the term Worship.</p>

<p>2. The second is the consecration of distinct places for the
purpose of carrying on such worship, or otherwise approaching
the Deity more closely and solemnly than can be done on common
and unsanctified ground. These I term <i>consecrated places</i>.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, we have a large class of objects dedicated expressly
to religious purposes. Such are votive offerings of all
kinds; pictures, statues, vestments, gifts bestowed on the priesthood
for employment in Divine worship, or whatever else the
piety of the devotees of any deity may induce them to withdraw
from their own consumption, and set apart for his service.
These are <i>consecrated objects</i>.</p>

<p>4. Devoutly disposed persons seek to enter into a more than
commonly direct relation with their god by dedication of their
own persons to him, such dedication being signified by some
special characteristics in their mode of life. Such are ascetics
of all descriptions, whether they be known as Essenes, Nazarites,
Bonzes, monks, or any other term. I describe them henceforward
as <i>consecrated persons</i>.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, we have a class of men who are also consecrated,
but who differ from the preceding in that the object of their
consecration is not personal but social. They are devoted to
the service of the deity not in order that they individually may
enter into more intimate relations with him, but that they may
carry on the needful intercourse between the community at
large and its gods. To emphasize this distinction, I call them
<i>consecrated mediators</i>.</p>

<p>The second great division of our subject is that which treats
of the several modes by which divine ideas are carried downwards.
And here we will follow a classification corresponding
as nearly as possible to that adopted in the preceding section.</p>

<p>1. First, then, the Deity conveys his will or his intention
through events; such as omens, auguries, miracles, dreams, and
many other phenomena. All these may be termed <i>holy events</i>.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, there are certain spots which are either favorable
to the reception of supernatural communications, or have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30"> 30</span>
on some occasion been the scene of such a communication,
which we will call <i>holy places</i>.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, certain objects are held to possess mysterious
powers, as that of healing disease. Relics, articles that have
been used by holy men, and such like remains, come within
this category. They may be described as <i>holy objects</i>.</p>

<p>4. All communities above the very lowest employ professional
persons for the express object of conveying to them the will of
their Deity, or discovering his intentions as to the future. The
most usual name for such functionaries is that of Priest, and
for the sake of embracing all ecclesiastical or quasi-ecclesiastical
classes under one designation I shall call them <i>holy orders</i>.</p>

<p>5. The possession of a professional character distinguishes
them from the next class, who serve as the fifth channel between
God and man, but who differ from the fourth in the circumstance
of being self-appointed. Prophets (for it is of these
I am speaking) receive no regular consecration; nevertheless
the part they have played in the religious history of mankind
has been of such transcendent importance that they deserve to
be placed in a class apart under the title of <i>holy persons</i>.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, there remains a mode of communication from God
to man to which there is nothing corresponding on our side; it
is that of written documents. Man has never (so far as I am
aware) imagined himself capable of sending a letter or written
composition of any kind to God; but God is supposed, through
the medium of human instruments, to have embodied his
thoughts in writing for the benefit of the human race. The
result is the very important category of <i>holy books</i>.</p>

<small>CONSECRATED ACTIONS.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Adoration, or worship, is a direct result of one of the most
universal of human instincts. After the instincts which impel
us to provide for the necessities of the body, and to satisfy the
passion of love, there is perhaps none more potent or more
general. Men are driven to pray by an irresistible impulse.
Differing widely as to the object of worship; differing not less
widely as to its mode; differing in a minor degree as to the
blessings it secures; they are agreed as to the fundamental
ideas which it involves. In the first place it presupposes a
power superior to, or at any rate different from, the power of
man; in the second place it assumes a belief that this superhuman
or non-human power can be approached by his worshipers;
can be induced to listen to their desires, and to grant their
petitions.</p>

<p>Of the first of the two elements thus implied in prayer, this
is not the appropriate place to speak at length. In a very early
and primitive stage of man's existence, he begins to feel his
dependence upon powers invisible to his mortal eyes, whose
mode of action he can but imperfectly comprehend. His way
of conceiving these beings will depend upon his mental elevation,
upon historical influences, upon local conditions, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32"> 32</span>
causes. Among very rude nations, the commonest and apparently
most unimpressive objects will serve as fetishes, or incarnations
of the mysterious force. Pieces of wood, stones, ornaments
worn on the person, or almost anything, may under
some circumstances do duty in this capacity. It is a further
stage of progress when the more conspicuous objects of nature,
lofty mountains, rivers, trees, fountains, and so forth, are deified,
to the exclusion of more insignificant things. Still higher
is the adoration of bodies which do not belong to this earth at
all, and whose nature is, therefore, more mysterious—the sun,
the moon, the planets or the stars, the clouds and tempests,
the winds, and similar imposing phenomena. And this stage
passes naturally into one where the gods, at first merely forces
of nature personified, lose their character of forces, and become
exclusively persons. They are then conceived as beings in human
form, but endowed with much more than human faculties.
Actual persons, especially the ancestors of the living generation,
are also the frequent recipients of religious adoration. By
other races, or by the same races at a later period, the numerous
gods of polytheism are merged in one supreme god, to
whom the others are subordinated as agents of his will, or
before whose grandeur they disappear altogether; while this
worship of powers conceived as beneficent is very frequently
accompanied, more or less avowedly, by a parallel worship of
powers conceived as malevolent, and whom, by reason of that
very malevolence, it is occasionally deemed the more needful to
conciliate.</p>

<p>The second element—the conviction that these deities are
accessible to human requests—is shown both by the fact of
worship being offered and by the mode in which it is conducted.
In the first place, it is plain that prayer would not be offered
at all but for the belief that it exercises some influence on the
beings prayed to. But the theory does not require that they
should be equally amenable to it at all times, from all persons,
or in whatever way it is uttered. On the contrary, accessibility
to prayer implies in these who receive it an inclination to listen
with attention to the language in which they are addressed,
and to be more or less moved by it according to its nature.</p>

<p>Reasoning from the authorities of earth whom he knows, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33"> 33</span>
those of heaven whom he does not know, the primitive man
concludes that the best way of obtaining the satisfaction of his
wishes from the latter will be to address them in a tone of
humble supplication, intermingled with such laudatory epithets
as he deems most suitable to the deity invoked, or most likely
to be agreeable to his ear. Hence we have the two devotional
acts of prayer and praise, which in all religions constantly accompany
one another, and constitute the simplest, most natural,
and most ancient expression on the part of human beings
of their consciousness of an overruling power, and of their
desire to enter into relations with that dreaded and venerated
agency.</p>

<p>Prayer in its original form is simply a request for some personal
advantage addressed by the worshipers to their god.
Whatever loftier associations it may afterwards acquire, its intention
at the outset is unquestionably this, as may be proved
by reference to innumerable instances, quoted by travelers or
scholars, of savage prayer, where the benefit expected from the
deity is demanded in the most barefaced manner. But even
after men have long ceased to be savages, the primary object
of prayer may easily be discerned; sometimes plainly avowed
by the persons praying, sometimes cloaked under complimentary
phrases or devotional utterances. However disguised, the
fact remains, that prayer was originally designed, and to a
large extent is designed still, to obtain certain advantages for
ourselves, either as individuals, or as a community. Private
prayer, partaking to some extent of the character of a meditation,
may, and no doubt often does, form an exception to this
rule; but even this very frequently falls under it, and of the
prayer offered by tribes or nations it always holds good.</p>

<p>Two excellent specimens of primitive prayer are given by
Brinton in his "Myths of the New World." According to that
writer, the Nootka Indian, on preparing for war, thus expresses
his wishes:—"Great Quahootzee, let me live, not be sick, find
the enemy, not fear him, find him asleep, and kill a great
many of him."</p>

<p>The next instance, quoted by him from Father Breboeuf, is
equally apposite. It is the prayer of a Huron:—"Oki, thou
who livest in this spot, I offer thee tobacco. Help us, save us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34"> 34</span>
from shipwreck, defend us from our enemies, give us a good
trade, and bring us back safe and sound to our villages" (M.
N. W., p. 297).</p>

<p>The Kafirs, according to Shooter, address the "spirits"
whom they worship in the following style: "Take care of me,
take care of my children, take care of my wives, take care of
all my people. Remove the sickness, and let my child recover.
Give me plenty of children—many boys and a few girls. Give
me abundance of food and cattle. Make right all my people"
(K. N., p. 163).</p>

<p>Of the negroes on the Caribbean Islands, Oldendorp says,
"Their concerns which they lay before God in their prayers,
even on their knees, have reference only to the body, to health,
fine weather, a good harvest, victory over their enemies, and
so forth" (G. d. M., p. 325).</p>

<p>The Samoans, on taking their evening "cup of ava," would
thus express their petitions to the gods: "Here is ava for you,
O gods! Look kindly towards this family: let it prosper and
increase; and let us all be kept in health. Let our plantations
be productive, let fruit grow, and may there be abundance of
food for us, your creatures. Here is ava for you, our war-gods!
Let there be a strong and numerous people for you in this
land. Here is ava for you, O sailing gods! Do not come on
shore at this place; but be pleased to depart along the ocean
to some other land" (N. Y., p. 200).</p>

<p>Mr. Turner, to whom I am indebted for the above prayer,
remarks that in Tanna, another of the Polynesian islands, the
chief of a village repeats a short prayer at the evening meal,
"asking health, long life, good crops, and success in battle"
(Ibid., p. 85).</p>

<p>The authors of the Vedic hymns, though standing on a far
higher level of civilization, do not differ essentially from these
rude people in the character of the objects for which they pray.
The several deities are continually invoked to grant health,
wealth, prosperity, posterity, and other temporal blessings.
Thus (to quote one instance among many) in Mandala 1, Sûkta
64, translated by Max Müller, the Maruts are requested to grant
"strength, glorious, invincible in battle, brilliant, wealth-conferring,
praiseworthy, known to all men;" and again, "wealth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35"> 35</span>
durable, rich in men, defying all onslaughts; wealth a hundred
and a thousandfold, always increasing" (R. V. S., i. 64, 14, 15,—Vol.
i. p. 93). The liturgies of the Zend-Avesta, while sometimes
assuming a loftier strain, frequently move upon the same
level. The same tone is to be observed in the Hebrew Scriptures.
Solomon's prayer, for instance, at the dedication of the
temple, may be taken as an enumeration of the objects commonly
prayed for among the ancient Hebrews. It specifies
among the objects to be obtained at the hands of Jehovah, the
prevention of famine, of pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust or
caterpillar, plague or sickness (1 Kings viii. 37). Christian liturgies
contain the same universal elements, though intermingled
with many others, and not in general put forward with the
same crudity of language.</p>

<p>Besides these general objects, there are others of an ephemeral
and special kind which are generally drawn within the
sphere of prayer. Rain is a common object of prayer, and other
changes of weather are equally prayed for if they are held to
be important. Callaway, for example, was informed by a "very
old man" in South Africa that "if it does not rain, the heads
of villages and petty chiefs assemble and go to a black chief;
they converse and pray for rain" (R. S. A., vol. i. p. 59). Another
native described the mode of supplication more particularly.
A certain chieftain named Utshaka "came and made his
prayers greater than those who preceded him." When he desired
rain, he sang the following song, which "consists of
musical sounds merely, without any meaning:"—</p>

<p>"<i>One Part</i>—I ya wu; a wu; o ye i ye."</p>

<p>"<i>Second Part or Response</i>—I ya wo."</p>

<p>And this prayer, so touching in its simplicity, was as successful
as the most elaborate composition of Jewish prophet or
Christian bishop; for the narrator states that Utshaka "Sang a
song and prayed to the Lord of heaven; and asked his forefathers
to pray for rain to the Lord of heaven. <i>And it rained</i>"
(R. S. A., vol. i. p. 92). The efficacy of prayer is plainly independent
of the creed of him who offers it.</p>

<p>The Mexicans held an important annual festival in the month
of May, of which the main purpose was to entreat for water
from the sky, this being the season at which there was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36"> 36</span>
greatest need of rain (H. I., b. v. ch. 28). They used to address
an elaborate prayer to a god named Tlaloc, the king of the terrestrial
paradise, to obtain deliverance from drought. They entreated
him not to visit the offenses they had committed with
such severity as to continue the privation under which they
were laboring.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Tannese, when put to much inconvenience
by the dust falling from a certain volcano, "were in the habit
of praying to their gods for a change of wind" (N. Y., p. 75).
Certain other South Sea Islanders used to pray to their gods to
avert the supposed calamity of a lunar eclipse. "As the eclipse
passes off, they think it is all owing to their prayers," a mode
of reasoning which presents an exact parallel to that employed
by many Christians.</p>

<p>Sir John Davis gives a very interesting specimen of a prayer
for rain employed by Taou-Kuâng, the Emperor of China, in
1832, on the occasion of a long drought in that country (Chinese,
vol. ii. p. 75). As may be expected from so civilized a people,
this prayer rises far above the outspoken begging of savage
petitions, yet it has in substance precisely the same end. The
emperor describes himself as "scorched with grief," and pathetically
inquires whether he has been remiss in sacrifice, has been
proud or prodigal, irreverent, unjust, or wanting in discretion in
the exercise of patronage. Here we see the intrusion of the
theological idea that calamities are sent as punishments for sin,
which plays no small part in Christian theology; but this only
serves to veil, without effacing, the essential character of the
prayer. The very same notion, that sin is visited by unfavorable
weather, is found in the prayer of Solomon, whose mind
upon this question seems to have been in the same stage of
thought as that attained by the Chinese emperor. "When
heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned
against thee" (1 Kings viii. 35), is the language of Solomon:
"My sins are so numerous that it is hopeless to escape
their consequences," so runs the penitent confession of Taou-Kuâng.
But whatever may be the cause to which the drought
is attributed, the prayer, whether uttered by Chinaman, Jew, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37"> 37</span>
Christian, is still simply the petition to the Amazulu, the South
Sea Islander, or the native American—a request that God will
so influence the phenomena of the skies as to suit our convenience.
The notion that this object may sometimes be attained
by our prayers is not extinct even among ourselves.</p>

<p>Other special occasions are sometimes held to call for prayer.
Such are national calamities; as a pestilence among men or
cattle, the illness of some eminent person, and other similar
misfortunes. A good harvest is very generally prayed for; so is
victory in time of war. The ancient Aryans, who composed the
Vedic hymns one thousand years or more before Christ, continually
prayed for this last blessing; and we ourselves, when
engaged in warfare, piously continue the same custom.</p>

<p>Very frequently the notion of a bargain between the god and
his worshiper appears in prayer. The worshiper claims to have
rendered some service for which the god ought in equity to
reward him; or he holds out the discontinuance of his former
devotion as a motive to induce the concession of his desires.
The constant conjunction of praise with prayer is explicable on
this principle of a reciprocity of benefits. If the worshiper
gains much from the god, yet the god gains something from
him, being addressed in a strain of unbounded eulogy. His
power, his greatness, his goodness, his excellences of all kinds
are vaunted in glowing terms, no doubt sincerely used by the
worshiper, but repeated and accumulated to satiety from an
impression that they are pleasing to their object, and may dispose
him to beneficence. Titles thus bestowed upon their deities
are aptly described by the Amazulus as "laud-giving names"
(R. S. A., vol. i. p. 72, and vol. ii. p. 149). In the Vedic hymns
and in the Psalms, the deities spoken of are constantly addressed
by such complimentary epithets. One of the hymns to
the Maruts begins by announcing the poet's intention to praise
"their ancient greatness." And at the conclusion, after he has
done so, he says, "May this praise, O Maruts, ... approach
you (asking) for offspring to our body, together with food. May
we find food, and a camp with running water" (R. V. S., vol. i.
pp. 197, 201). The Psalmists were never weary of exalting the
extraordinary might and majesty of Jehovah, mingling petitions
with panegyric; and a large portion of the worship of Christians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38"> 38</span>
consists in expressions of pious admiration at the extraordinary
goodness of their God, especially for his redemption of the
world which he had himself condemned. All these extravagant
eulogies betray a latent impression that the Deity is, after all,
a very arbitrary personage, and may be moved to more merciful
conduct than he would otherwise pursue by large doses of
flattery.</p>

<p>Still more clearly does the idea of a commercial relationship
with the gods make its appearance in a poet who stands on a
higher intellectual and moral level than the writers of the Hebrew
Psalms, namely Aischylos. In the Seven against Thebes,
Eteokles implores Zeus, the Earth, and the tutelar deities of
the city to protect Thebes; and subjoins as a motive for compliance,
"And I trust that what I say is our common interest;
for a prosperous city honors the gods" (Aisch. Sept. c. Th. 76,
77—Dindorf). And there is a similar appeal to the divine selfishness
further on in the same play, where the chorus inquires
of the gods what better plain they can expect to obtain in exchange
for this one, if they shall suffer it to pass into the enemy's
hands (Aisch., Sept. c. Th. 304).</p>

<p>In the Choephoræ, Zeus is distinctly asked in the prayer of
Agamemnon's children whence he can expect to obtain the sacrifice
and honors which have been paid him by Orestes and
Electra if he should suffer them to perish (Aisch., Choeph., 255).
While in the Electra of Sophocles the converse motive of gratitude
is appealed to: the god Apollon being desired to remember
not what he may get, but what he already has got, from
the piety of his supplicant (Soph. El., 1376—Schneidewin). And
Jacob, who was a good hand at a bargain, makes his terms
with Jehovah in a thoroughly business-like spirit. "<i>If</i> God
will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and
will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come
again to my father's house in peace; <i>then</i> shall the Lord be
my God: and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall
be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely
give the tenth unto thee." The adoption of Jehovah as Jacob's
God being thus entirely dependent on the performance by that
Deity of his share in the contract (Gen. xxviii. 20-22).</p>

<p>Sometimes it is quaintly suggested that were the worshiper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39"> 39</span>
in the place of the god, <i>he</i> would not neglect the interests of
his devotee. Thus, the author of a hymn in the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ,
addressing the Gods of Tempest, exclaims: "If you, sons
of Prisni, were mortals, and your worshiper an immortal, then
never should your praiser be unwelcome, like a deer in pasture
grass, nor should he go on the path of Yama" (R. V. S., vol.
i. p. 65). Another unsophisticated poet gives the following hint
to the god Indra, the Hindu Jupiter: "Were I, Indra, like
thee, the sole lord of wealth, the singer of my praises should
be rich in cattle" (S. V., i. 2. i. 3. p. 218). And the same god
is asked elsewhere in the Veda: "When wilt thou make us
happy? for it is just this that is desired" (S. V., i. 5. i. 3. p.
233). With equal plainness is the expectation of a <i>quid pro quo</i>
enunciated in one of the most ancient hymns, contained in the
sacred books of the Parsees:—"Every adoration, O True One,
consists in actions whereby one may obtain good possessions,
full of security, and happiness round about" (F. G. vol. ii. p.
54.—Yama 51. i).</p>

<p>More emphatically still is this conception of a reciprocity of
benefits expressed in another consecrated action, that of Sacrifice.
Sacrifice holds a most important place in all religions.
It originates in a stage of the human mind which, if not quite
as primitive as that which gives rise to prayer, is nevertheless
so early as to be practicably inseparable from it. Wherever
we find prayer, we find sacrifice; but as the latter is generally
found organized under definite forms, and confined to certain
specified objects, we may conclude that in the state in which
we recognize it, it implies a certain degree of regulation and
forethought on the part of religious authorities which we do
not meet with in the simplest types of prayer. Prayer is often
the mere natural outpouring of our wants before a power which
is considered capable of fulfilling them: sacrifice, though doubtless
in the first instance an equally artless offering of gifts to
beings who are regarded with veneration and gratitude, is soon
converted into a formal presentation of acknowledged dues,
performed under ecclesiastical supervision. No doubt prayer
also tends to assume this formal character; but we have hitherto
considered it in its uncorrupted aspect; its treatment in
its later developments belongs to another portion of this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40"> 40</span></p>

<p>The idea which presides over sacrifice is obvious. The sacrificer
argues that if he can make acceptable presents to the
gods, they will smile upon him and be disposed to promote his
ends; whereas if he keeps the whole of his possessions for
worldly purposes, they will regard him with indignation, and
refuse him their assistance when he may happen to stand in
need of it. There is also involved in sacrifice a sense of gratitude:
the gods having given us the fruits of the earth,
behooves us to make some acknowledgment of their bounty.</p>

<p>Such notions, once propounded, were certain to be fertile.
Every motive of piety and of interest would combine to support
them. The piety of the worshipers, coupled with their hopes
of advantage, would be stimulated by the self-interest of the
priests, who generally share in the sacrifices offered. If any
piece of good fortune occurred to one who was devout and liberal
in sacrificing, it would be attributed to the satisfaction felt
by the gods at his exemplary conduct. If ill fortune befell
those who had neglected to sacrifice, this would be an equally
manifest indication of their high displeasure. As soon, therefore,
as the step was taken—and it was one of the earliest in
the religious history of man—of instituting sacrifices to idols
or to deities, the worshipers vied with one another in the liberality
of their offerings. Adopted as a mode of propitiating the
celestial beings by spontaneous gifts, it became, among all
nations whose religious belief had arrived at a state of flexity
and consolidation, a positive duty; much as monarchs have
frequently exacted large and burdensome contributions under
the guise of voluntary presents.</p>

<p>Illustrations of this conception, that sacrifice is a sort of
payment for services rendered or to be rendered, might be found
abundantly in many quarters. Perhaps it is seldom more
quaintly expressed than by the Amazulus, who, when going to
battle, sacrifice to the Amatongo, or manes of their ancestors,
in order that these, in their own language, "may have no cause
of complaint, because they have made amends to them, and
made them bright." On reaching the enemy, they say, "Can
it be, since we have made amends to the Amadhlozi, that they
will say we have wronged them by anything?" And when it
comes to fighting, they are filled with valor, observing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41"> 41</span>
"the Amatongo will turn their backs on us without cause" (R.
S. A., vol. ii. p. 133).</p>

<p>The objects of sacrifice are very various, but it is noticeable
that they are almost invariably things held in esteem among
men, and either possessing a considerable value as commodities,
or capable by their properties of ministering to their pleasure.
All sacrifices of meat and corn or other edibles belong to the
former class; those of flowers to the latter, for these, though
of little value in the market yet give great pleasure, and are
much esteemed. An exception is indeed presented by the wild
hordes in Kamtschatka, who, according to Steller, offer nothing
to their gods but what is valueless to themselves (Kamtschatka,
p. 265). If this statement does not originate in a misunderstanding
of the traveler, the fact must be due to the singularly low
religiosity of those people, who seem to have little reverence
for the very objects of their worship.</p>

<p>The most valuable sacrifice that can possibly be made—that
of human beings—has always been common among savage
or uncivilized nations. Thus, in some of the South Sea
Islands, human sacrifices were "fearfully common" (N. M. E.,
p. 547). They prevailed among some of the negro tribes known
to the missionary Oldendorp (G. d. M., p. 329).</p>

<p>In Mexico, where the natives had arrived at a far higher
condition, human sacrifices still prevailed, though the original
brutality of the rite was modified by the fact of the victims
being enemies. Indeed, Montezuma, when at the height of his
power, expressly refused to conquer a certain province which
he might easily have added to his dominions; assigning as his
first reason, that he desired to keep the Mexican youth in practice;
as his second and principal one, that he might reserve a
province for the supply of victims to sacrifice to the gods (H. I.,
b. v. ch. 20).</p>

<p>At the great Mexican festival of the Jubilee, however, it was
not an enemy, but a slave, who was offered. This slave had
represented the idol during the period of a year, and had
received the greatest honor during his term of office, at the
end of which his head was severed from his body by the priest,
who then held it as high as he could, and showed it to the Sun
and to the idol (H. I., b. v. ch. 28).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42"> 42</span></p>

<p>Next in value to the human race are cattle, and these too
are frequently immolated in honor of the gods. Thus among
the Kafirs, "the animals offered are exclusively cattle and
goats. The largest ox in a herd is specially reserved for sacrifices
on important occasions; it is called the Ox of the Spirits,
and is never sold except in cases of extreme necessity" (Kafirs,
p. 165). Here we find it expressly stated that it is the best ox,
in other words, the most valuable portion of the sacrificer's
property, which is devoted to the gods. And the principle
which leads in Natal to this reservation of the best will be
found predominating over sacrifice throughout the world. The
Soosoos, a people inhabiting the west coast of Africa, are so
careful to propitiate their deity, that they "never undertake
any affair of importance until they have sacrificed to him a bullock"
(N. A., vol. i. p. 230).</p>

<p>Other domestic and edible animals, being of great importance
to mankind, are held worthy of the honor of sacrifice.
The same writer to whom I owe the last quotation tells us of
the Western Africans, that "before they begin to sow their
plantations, they sacrifice a sheep, goat, fowl, or fish to the
ay-min, to beg that their crop may abound; for were this
neglected, they are persuaded that nothing would grow there"
(Ibid., vol. i. p. 223). Oldendorp, who was particularly familiar
with the Caribbean Islands, describes the sacrifices of the
negroes as consisting of "oxen, cows, sheep, goats, hens, palm-oil,
brandy, yams, &amp;c." (G. d. M., p. 329).</p>

<p>Besides porcelain collars, tobacco, maize, and skins, the
American Indians used to offer "entire animals, especially
dogs, on the borders of difficult or dangerous roads or rocks, or
by the side of rapids." These offerings were made to the
spirits who presided in these places. The great value attached
by the natives of America to the dog is well known, and it is
deserving of remark that the dog was the commonest victim,
and that at the war-festival, which was a sort of sacrifice, it
was always dogs that were offered.</p>

<p>In China, the animals slain are "bullocks, heifers, sheep, and
pigs," which are duly purified for a certain period beforehand
(C. O., vol. ii. p. 192). Among the Jews, pigs, whose flesh was
regarded as impure, were not offered; bullocks, goats, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43"> 43</span>
sheep were the chief sacrificial animals; and extreme care was
taken in their law that they should be entirely without blemish;
that is, that, like the ox of the Kafirs, they should be the
best obtainable (Lev. xxii. 17-25). This is a remarkable illustration
of the tendency to offer only articles of value in human
estimation to God; for here that which would be good enough
for men is treated as unfit for Jehovah. Animals of lesser
magnitude are sometimes offered; as, for instance, the quails
which the Mexicans used to sacrifice (H. I., b. v. ch. 18). Birds
are not unfrequently chosen as fitting objects to present to the
gods. Among the Ibos, a negro tribe, it is the custom for
women, six weeks after childbirth, to present a pair of hens as
an offering, which, however, are not killed, but liberated after
certain ceremonies. In like manner the Hebrew woman after
her delivery was enjoined to bring a lamb and a pigeon or turtle-dove;
or, if she were unable to bring the lamb, two young
pigeons or two turtle-doves (Lev. xii. 6-8). In addition to animals,
a considerable variety of objects is sacrificed, generally
the fruits of the earth or flowers. There is, however, no limit
to the number of things which may be held suitable for presentation
to the gods. Thus, in Samoa (in Polynesia), the offerings
were "principally cooked food" (N. Y. p. 241). In other Islands
"the first fruits are presented to the gods" (Ibid., p. 327), a
practice which corresponds, as the missionary who records it
justly remarks, to that of the ancient Israelites. The Red
Indians used to offer to their spirits "petun, tobacco, or birds."
In honor of the Sun, and even of subordinate spirits, they
would throw into the fire everything they were in the habit of
using, and which they acknowledged as received from them
(N. F., vol. iii. pp. 347, 348). Acosta divides the sacrifices of the
Mexicans and Peruvians into three classes: the first, of inanimate
objects; the second, of animals; the third, of men. In
the first class are included cocoa, maize, colored feathers, seashells,
gold and silver, and fine linen (H. I., b. v. ch. 18).
Among the sacrifices offered by the Incas to the sun, the most
esteemed, according to Garcilasso de la Vega, were lambs, then
sheep, then barren ewes. Besides these, they sacrificed tame
rabbits, all <i>edible</i> birds (remark the limitation), and fat of
beasts, as well as all the grains and vegetables up to cocoa, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44"> 44</span>
the finest linen (observe again the care that it should be fine)
(C. R., b. ii. ch. 8). At a certain Hindu festival described by
Wilson, a goddess named Varadá Chaturthi "is worshipped
with offerings of flowers, of incense, or of lights, with platters
of sugar and ginger, or milk or salt, with scarlet or saffron-tinted
strings and golden bracelets" (W. W., vol. ii. pp. 184, 185).
Among the Parsees the sacrifices consist of little loaves of
bread, and of Haoma, the sacred plant. The Indian Parsees
send from time to time to Kirman to obtain Haoma-branches
from this holy territory (Z. A., vol. ii. p. 535). The Parsees also
offer flowers, fruits, rice, odoriferous grains, perfumes, milk,
roots of certain trees, and meat. The Jews, like them, offered
the productions of the soil in sacrifice.</p>

<p>Beauty, and even utility, when not accompanied by considerable
value in exchange, do not suffice to constitute fitness for
religious sacrifice. Common plants and shrubs, branches of
trees, wild birds or insects, are some of them among the most
beautiful productions of nature; yet they are not sacrificed.
Stones and wood are both useful, but they are obtained, as a
rule, at little cost; and they are not sacrificed. Flowers, which
certainly have no high value, were sometimes offered to idols
in the form of wreaths and garlands: they scarcely constitute
an exception to the rule, for they are prized as ornaments by
men, and the process of plucking and weaving them into appropriate
shapes imposes trouble—the equivalent of cost—on the
devotee. It is plainly not owing to any accidental circumstance
that highly valuable objects have been selected by all the
nations of the earth as alone appropriate for religious sacrifice.
Two reasons may be assigned for this selection. In the first
place, the general assimilation of deities to mankind goes far
to account for it. Everywhere, and at all times—as we shall
have occasion frequently to observe in this work—men have
reasoned as to the divine nature from their knowledge of their
own. A noteworthy instance of this is to be seen in Malachi,
who does not scruple to tell the Jews that their God feels the
same kind of offense at the poverty of their offerings as a
human governor would do. "And if," says that prophet, "ye
offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the
lame and sick, is it not evil? <i>offer it now unto thy governor</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45"> 45</span>
will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?  saith the
Lord of hosts." A few verses later he recurs to the sorrow felt
by Jehovah at such insults. "And ye bring that which is
robbed, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring an offering:
should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord. But cursed
be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth
and sacrificeth unto the Lord a bad female." It would be difficult
to find the theory of God's resemblance to man expressed
in a cruder form. Even as a governor will show the greatest
favor to those who approach him with the costliest gifts, so the
mouthpiece of the Hebrew deity declares in his name that he
must have the pick of his servant's flocks—the males, not the
females, the sound and the perfect, not the sickly or the
maimed. In a precisely similar spirit, it is enjoined in one of
the sacred books of the Buddhists that no spoilt victuals or
drinks may be used in sacrifice (Wassiljew, p. 211).</p>

<p>Men's notion of their god was often derived, like Malachi's,
not only from human nature, but from those who were by no
means the best specimens of human nature,—the rulers. The
religious emotion, imbued with this conception of its deities,
shrank through a sense of piety from the irreverent, and, as it
seemed, sacrilegious act of presenting them with anything but
the best. But there was another reason which, doubtless, had
its weight. Not only must the offering be of a kind acceptable
to the god to whom it was given; it must also impose some
cost upon the worshiper. Religious sentiment imperatively required
that there should be an actual sacrifice of something
which the owner valued, and the surrender of which imposed a
burden upon him. This seemed to be involved in the very
notion of sacrifice. Its sense and purpose was, that the devotee,
coming to his god, and desiring to obtain some favor from
him, should show the high importance he attached to it by
parting with some portion of his possessions. And plainly this
portion must be such as to indicate by its character the esteem
and reverence felt by the worshiper for the being whom he
worshiped. To indicate this, it must be something which he
would unwillingly resign but for his religious feelings. Hence
a special part of the fruits of the soil would be an appropriate
offering. It would involve a real diminution in the wealth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46"> 46</span>
the worshiper, a real surrender of something useful and valuable
to mankind. To these two reasons may be added a third,
which, no doubt, must have had its weight. In many cases, a
portion of the sacrifices was the property of the priests. As
will be more fully shown hereafter, the priesthood frequently
contrived to transfer to themselves the piety which was felt
towards the gods. Hence the sacrifices, originally given to the
divine beings, were in part appropriated by their ministers;
and it was obviously of importance to them that the thing sacrificed
should be such as they could profit by and enjoy.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the sacrifice, or a portion of it, is
consumed either by the worshipers in general, or by their
priests. A case of the former kind is mentioned by Oldendorp.
When the young men among the Tembus (negroes) are going
to battle, the old men offer sheep and hens to their god Zioo
for their success; the blood and bowels they bestow upon Zioo,
and the flesh they eat themselves (G. d. M., p. 330). Sometimes
the thing sacrificed is itself regarded as an idol or god, and is
eaten religiously, under a belief that it is a food of peculiar
efficacy. Such is the case with the Christian sacrament; and
such was the case, too, with the remarkable custom observed
among the Mexicans at the feast of Vitziliputzli, where an idol
composed of corn and honey used to be solemnly consecrated,
and afterwards distributed to be eaten by the people, who received
it with extreme reverence, awe, and tears, as the flesh
and bones of the god himself (H. I., b. v. ch. 24). It is an exception,
however, when the laity partake in the consumption of
the sacrifices; they are generally reserved for the priests.
Among the Jews, it was the privilege of the priests to eat certain
portions of the animals brought for sacrifice; and in like
manner the Parsee priest, or Zaota, eats the bread and drinks
the Haoma (Av., vol. ii. p. lxxii). And it deserves especial mention,
that the Haoma, a plant of which the juice is thus drunk
in certain rites both in the Indian and the Parsee religions, is
in both considered a god as well as a plant; just as the wine of
the Christian sacrament is both the juice of the grape and the
blood of the Redeemer (Av., vol. i. p. 8).</p>

<p>In the above cases, food consecrated to the gods is eaten by
men. The converse practice, that of bestowing a portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47"> 47</span>
ordinary food of men upon the gods, is also common. The
habit of the ancients of making libations is well known. But
the same practice has prevailed, or prevails still, in many distinct
parts of the world. A traveler who visited Tartary in the
thirteenth century states that it was the custom of the Tartar
chiefs of one thousand or one hundred men, before they ate or
drank anything, to offer some of it to an idol which they always
kept in the middle of their dwelling place (Bergeron, Voyage
de Carpin, art. iii., p. 30). In Samoa, when a family feast was
held in honor of the household gods, "a cup of their intoxicating
ava draught was poured out as a drink-offering" (N. Y.,
p. 239). Among the Soosoos, on the west coast of Africa, a custom
prevails "which resembles the ancient practice of pouring
out a libation: they seldom or never drink spirits, wine, etc.,
without spilling a little of it upon the ground, and wetting the
gree-gree or fetish hung round the neck: at the same time they
mutter a kind of short prayer" (N. A., p. 123). Again, in Sierra
Leone, "when they want to render their devil propitious to any
undertaking, they generally provide liquor: a very small libation
is made to him, and the rest they drink before his altar"
(S. L., p. 66). While in Thibet, "the execution by a Lama is
not required for the usual libations to the personal genii, nor to
those of the house, the country, etc., in whose honor it is the
custom to pour out upon the ground some drink or food, and
to fill one of the offering vessels ranged before their images
before eating or drinking one's self" (B. T., p. 247).</p>

<p>Great importance is in all religions attached to sacrifice. It
is universally supposed to conciliate, to soften, or to appease the
deity in whose honor it is offered. Sometimes it is even conceived
to have an actual material power of its own, the spirits
deriving a positive benefit from the food presented to them.
Spiegel states that the subordinate genii in the Parsee hierarchy
of angels derive from the sacrifices strength and vigor to fulfil
their duties (Av., vol. ii. p. lxiii). Generally, however, the conception
of the influence of sacrifice is less materialistic. The
Amazulus naively express the general sentiment by saying, that,
in prospect of a battle, they sacrifice to their ancestors in order
that they "may have no cause of complaint." Much more
mystical were the views entertained on this point by the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48"> 48</span>
Hindus, among whom the theory of sacrifice was probably more
highly elaborated than in any other nation. Of a certain sacrificial
ceremony it is stated, that the gods, after having performed
it, "gained the celestial world. Likewise a sacrificer,
after having done the same, gains the celestial world" (A. B.,
vol. ii. p. 22). And it is added, that the sacrificer who performs
this rite "succeeds in both worlds, and obtains a firm footing
in both worlds" (A. B., vol. ii. p. 25). While to another rite the
following promise is attached: "He who, knowing this, sacrifices
according to this rite, is born (anew) from the womb of
Agni and the offerings, and participates in the nature of the
Rik, Yajus, and Sâman, the Veda (sacred knowledge), the Brahma
(sacred element), and immortality, and is absorbed in the
deity" (A. B., vol. ii. p. 51). Often it is the forgiveness of some
offense that is sought to be obtained by pacifying the indignant
deity with a gift. In the Jewish law a large portion of the sacrifices
enjoined have this object. They are termed sin-offerings
or trespass-offerings.</p>

<p>The general idea which leads to sacrifice is in all religions
the same. Respect is intended to be shown to the deity in
whose honor the sacrifice is made by depriving ourselves of
some valuable possession, and bestowing it on him. The pleasure
supposed to be felt by God on receiving such presents is
somewhat coarsely but emphatically expressed in the Hebrew
Bible by the statement that when Aaron had made a sacrifice
in the wilderness there came a fire from the Lord and consumed
the meat which had been laid upon the altar (Lev. ix. 24).</p>

<p>Christianity offers only an apparent exception to the rule of
the universal predominance of this idea. We do not, indeed,
find among Christians the periodical and stated offerings, either
of animals or of the products of the soil, which exist elsewhere.
Nevertheless, the idea of sacrifice subsists among them in all
its force. Indeed, it is the fundamental conception of the Christian
religion itself, in which the sacrifice of the founder upon
the cross embodies all those notions which are held to legitimate
the custom of sacrificing among heathen nations. We
have first the notion of an angry and exacting deity, who can
only be rendered placable towards mankind by the surrender to
him of some valuable thing; we have, consequently, the sacri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49"> 49</span>fice
of the most valuable thing that can possibly be offered,
namely, the life of a human being; we have, lastly, the belief
that this sacrifice was accepted, and that promises of mercy were
in consequence held out to the human race. By a peculiar exaltation
of the idea, the life thus given up is declared to be that
of his own son—a conception by which the value of the sacrifice,
and consequently the advantages it is capable of procuring,
are indefinitely heightened.</p>

<p>Thus the idea of sacrifice is carried to its extreme limits in
the religion of Christendom. Had it not been for the absolute
necessity of some sacrifice being offered to God, there would—according
to the theory of the Christian faith—have been absolutely
no reason for the execution of Christ. He might have
taught every doctrine associated with his name, performed every
miracle related in the Gospels, have drawn to himself every disciple
named in them, and yet have died, like the Buddha, in
the calm of a venerated and untroubled old age. He was
obliged to undergo this painful and melancholy death, if we
accept the general belief of Christendom, solely because God
required a sacrifice, and because without that sacrifice he could
not forgive the offenses of mankind.</p>

<p>Simple prayer and sacrifice are, then, the most primitive and
most general methods by which man approaches those whom
his nature impels him to worship. But as these acts are repeated
from time to time, and as their frequent repetition is
supposed to be highly agreeable to their objects, it naturally happens
that some particular mode of performing them comes to
be preferred to others. By and by, the mode of worship usually
adopted will become habitual; and a habit once formed will be
strengthened by every repetition of the acts in question. Not
only will certain forms of prayer, certain ways of sacrificing, certain
postures, certain gestures, and a certain order of proceeding
become established as usual and regular, but they will be regarded
as the only appropriate and respectful forms, every attempt
to depart from them being treated as a sacrilegious innovation.
The form will be deemed no less essential than the substance.</p>

<p>Hence Ritual, which we do not find in the most primitive
religions, but which is discovered in all of those that have
advanced to a higher type. Even in the earliest Vedic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50"> 50</span>
hymns—those of the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ—we perceive clear traces of
an established ritual from the manner in which the sacrifices
are spoken of as having been duly offered. In the Zend-Avesta,
elaborate ritualistic directions are given for certain specified
purposes, especially for that of purification after any defilement.
The oldest books of the Jewish Bible are in like manner full of
instructions for the due observance of ritual. Both the Buddhists,
who broke off from Brahminism, and the Christians, who
made a schism from Judaism, established a ritual of their own;
and this ritual was soon regarded as no less sacred than that
which they had abandoned. Everywhere, when religion has
passed out of its first unsettled condition, we find a fixed ritual,
and its fixity is one of its most striking features. Dogmas, in
spite of the efforts of sacerdotal orders, inevitably change. If
the words in which they are expressed remain unaltered, yet
the meaning attached to them continually varies. But ritual
does not change, or changes only when some great convulsion
uproots the settled institutions of the country. From age to
age the same forms and the same prayers remain, sometimes
long after their original meaning has been forgotten.</p>

<p>Thus prayer, ceasing to be spontaneous and irregular, becomes
formal, ceremonial, and regular. And as there are many
occasions besides sacrifice on which men desire to pray, so there
will be many besides this on which the craving for order, and
the readiness to believe that God is better pleased with one
form of devotion than another, will lead to the establishment
of ritual.</p>

<p>Rites may be performed daily, weekly, or at any other interval.
Sometimes, indeed, they are still more frequent, haunting
the every-day life of the devotee, and intruding upon his commonest
actions. Thus the Parsees are required to repeat certain
prayers on rising, before and after eating, on going to bed, on
cutting their nails or their hair, and on several other natural
occasions, besides praying to the sun three times a day (Z. A.,
vol. ii. p. 564-567). The Jews are encompassed with obligations
which, if less minute, are of a like burdensome character. A
devout Jew has to repeat a certain prayer on rising; he has to
wear garments of a particular kind, and to wash and dress in a
particular order (Rel. of Jews, p. 1-8). Mussulmans are com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51"> 51</span>manded
to pray five times a day, turning their faces towards
Mecca (Sale, prel. discourse, pp. 76, 77).</p>

<p>Ritual, however, is not always of this purely personal nature,
but is generally performed by a congregation to whose needs
it refers, or by priests on their behalf. And in this case, again,
a longer or shorter interval may elapse between the recurrence
of the rites. In the Mexican temples, for instance, the ministering
priests were in the habit of performing a service before
their idols four times a day (H. I., b. v. ch. p. 14). "The perpetual
exercise of the priests," says Acosta, speaking of these
temples, "is to offer incense to the idols." The ritual of the
Catholic Church, like that of the ancient Mexicans, is repeated
every day. The morning and evening services of the Church of
England were framed with the same intention; and the Ritualistic
clergy, rightly conceiving the teaching of their Church,
have introduced the practice of so employing them. Weekly or
bi-monthly observances prevail among Hindus, Singhalese,
Jews, and Christians. With the Hindus, the seventh lunar day,
both during the fortnight of the moon's waxing and during that
of her waning, is a festival, the first seventh day in the month
being peculiarly holy, and observed with very special rites.
More than this, the weekly period is known to them; for,
according to Wilson, "a sort of sanctity is, or was, attached
even to Sunday, and fasting on it was considered obligatory or
meritorious" (W. W., vol. ii. p. 199). In Ceylon the people
attend divine service twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays;
besides which, there are in each month four days devoted
to religious acts—the 8th, 15th, 23d, and 30th (A. I. C., pp. 222,
223; H. R. C., p. 76). The Jewish ritual differs on the Sabbath-day
from that used on week-days; and such is the solemnity
attached to this festival, that a quasi-personality is attributed
to the day itself, which is exalted in the service for Friday
evening as the bride of God, and which the congregation is invited
to go in quest of, and to meet (Rel. of Jews, p. 128). A
similar sanctity is considered by many Christians to pertain to
the Sunday, while all of them observe it as an important festival,
and mark it by peculiar rites. Friday, too, is regarded by the
majority of Christians as a day to be observed with distinctive
rites, of which fasting is the principal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52"> 52</span></p>

<p>When the interval observed between the performance of
certain rites exceeds some very short period—as a day or week—it
is generally a year. In this case, the time, whether it be
a month, a week, a few days, or any other period, set apart for
their performance assumes the character of a Festival. Under
the general term Festival I include any annually recurrent
season, whether it be one of mourning or rejoicing, of fasting
or feasting, which is consecrated by the observance of special
ceremonies of a religious order. In all religions above the lowest
stage such festivals occur. The time of their occurrence is
generally marked out by the seasons of the year. Mid-winter,
or the season of sowing; spring, or the time when the seed is
in the ground or beginning to spring up; and autumn, when
the harvest has been gathered in,—are the most natural seasons
for festivals; and it is at these that they usually take
place. For instance, Oldendorp states that nearly all the Guinea
nations have an annual harvest-festival, at which solemn thank-offerings
are presented to the Gods (G. d. M., p. 332). In China,
this reference to the seasons is obvious. "At every new moon,
and the change of the season, there are festivals." Of these,
"the most imposing" is "the emperor's plowing the sacred
field. This takes place when the sun enters the fifteenth degree
of Aquarius." But the precise day is determined by astrologers.
This is the winter festival, or that of sowing. The "Leih-chun,
at the commencement of the spring, continues for ten days."
And in autumn the feast of harvest is celebrated with great
merriment (C. O., vol. ii. p. 195-199). The Parsees have numerous
festivals, which it would be tedious to enumerate in detail
(Z. A., vol. ii. p. 574-581.). After the Gahanbars, which refer to
creation, the two principal ones are the No rouz and the Meherdjan,
and of these Anquetil du Perron expressly states that
the first originally corresponded to spring, and the second to
Autumn (Ibid., vol. ii. p. 603). Of the Hindu festivals described
by Wilson, by far the greatest are the Pongol, at the beginning
of the year, and the Holi, in the middle of March (W. W., vol.
ii. p. 151). Compared with these, the rest are insignificant; and
these plainly refer to the processes of nature. That the great
festivals of the Jews had the same reference, needs no proof;
for the passover took place in spring, and the feast of Pente<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53"> 53</span>cost,
as well as the feast of tabernacles, after harvest. Our
Christmas and Easter correspond to the Pongol and Holi of the
Hindus in point of time; and even the observances usual at
Christmas have, as Wilson has pointed out, much resemblance
to those of the Pongol.</p>

<p>There are in Ceylon five annual festivals, of which one,
occurring at the commencement of the year (in April), is marked
by the singular circumstance that "before New Year's day
every individual procures from an astrologer a writing, fixing
the fortunate hours of the approaching year on which to commence
duties or ceremonies." Of the five festivals the most
important was the Paraherra, which lasted from the new moon
to the full moon in July, and consisted mainly in a series of
religious processions, concluding with one in which the casket
containing the Dalada, or tooth of Buddha, was borne upon an
elephant. The fifth festival, called that of "New Rice," was
held at the commencement of the great harvest, and was the
occasion of offerings made with a view to good crops (E. Y.,
vol. i. p. 314-318).</p>

<p>The consecrated actions by which men seek to recommend
themselves to their gods at these special seasons are very various.
It would be useless to attempt to enumerate them at
length. Of the manner in which New Year's day is observed
among the Chinese (C. O., vol. ii. pp. 194, 195), the commencement
of the year among Hindus (W. W., vol. ii. p. 158 ff.), and
Christmas among ourselves, it will be unnecessary to speak at
all, for there is little of a religious character in these festivals.
Indeed, New Year's day in China seems to be a merely secular
festival; while the Christmas season in European countries,
though varnished over with a religious gloss, is in reality palpably
one of popular rejoicing, handed down from our pagan
ancestors, and placed in a legendary relation to the birth of
Christ. The religious rites which may accompany this festival
have therefore a secondary importance. Those observed at
other times bear reference either to the frame of mind induced
by the season, or to the particular legend commemorated; or
they may be purely arbitrary and enjoined by ecclesiastical
authority. An example of the first kind is the Jewish feast of
tabernacles, when the harvest had been gathered in, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54"> 54</span>
Jews were enjoined to carry boughs of trees and rejoice seven
days (Lev. xxiii. 40). Examples of the second class are common.
Legends are frequently related in order to account for
festivals, while sometimes festivals may be instituted in consequence
of a legend. Thus, the extraordinary story of the manifestation
of Siva as an interminable Linga, is told by the Hindus
to account for their worship of that organ on the twenty-seventh
of February (W. W., vol. ii. p. 211). In this case, the
rites have reference to the legend; the setting up a Linga in
their houses, consecrating, and offering to it, are ceremonies
which refer to the event present in the minds of the worshipers;
but it is more natural to suppose that the existence of the rites
led to the invention of the legend, than that the legend induced
the establishment of the rites. "The three essential observances,"
says Wilson, "are fasting during the whole Tithi, or
lunar day, and holding a vigil and worshiping the Linga during
the night; but the ritual is loaded with a vast number of directions,
not only for the presentation of offerings of various kinds
to the Linga, but for gesticulations to be employed, and prayers
to be addressed to various subordinate divinities connected with
Siva, and to Siva himself in a variety of forms" (Ibid., vol. ii.
p. 212). At another of the Hindu festivals, the effigy of Kama
is burnt, to commemorate the fact of that god having been
reduced to ashes by flames from Siva, and having been subsequently
restored to life at the intercession of Siva's bride (W.
W., vol. ii. p. 231). In like manner the jesting of the Greek
woman at the Thesmophoria was explained by reference to the
laughter of Demeter (Bib., i. 5. 1.). The Jewish passover was
eaten with rites which were symbolical of the state of the nation
just before its escape from Egypt, the time to which their
tradition assigned the original passover; and the ritual in use
among Christians at Easter bears reference to the story of
Christ's resurrection, which in this case no doubt preceded the
institution of the festival. The third class of rites—those which
are purely arbitrary or have a merely theological significance—are
the most usual of all. These, as will be obvious at once,
may vary indefinitely. Fasting is one of the most usual of such
observances. It is practiced by the Hindus at many of their
festivals, by Mussulmans during the month of Ramadan, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55"> 55</span>
by Christians in Lent. Bathing is also a common religious
practice of the Hindus at their festivals. The use of holy water
by Catholics on entering their churches is a ceremony of a similar
kind, and no doubt having the same intention, that of
purification. The Jews were to sacrifice at all their festivals,
and on one of them to afflict their souls (Lev. xxiii. 27). Christians,
among whom there are very numerous festivals, vary
their ritual according to the character of the day.</p>

<p>One or two specimens of the rites observed on festival days
will suffice as an illustration. The Peruvians, in their pagan
days, used to have festivals every month: the greatest of these
was that of the Trinity, celebrated in December. "In this
feast," says Acosta, "they sacrificed a great number of sheep
and lambs, and they burnt them with worked and odoriferous
wood; and some sheep carried gold and silver, and they placed
on them the three statues of the Sun, and the three of Thunder;
father, brother, and son, whom they said that the Sun
and Thunder had. In this feast they dedicated the Inca children,
and placed the Guacas, or ensigns on them, and the old
men whipped them with slings, and anointed their faces with
blood, all in token that they should be loyal knights of the
Inca. No stranger might remain during this month and feast
at Cuzco, and at the end all those from without entered; and
they gave them those pieces of maize with the blood of the
sacrifice, which they eat, in token of confederation with the
Inca" (H. I., b. 5. ch. 27). Equally curious are the rites prescribed
by the Catholic Church for Holy Saturday. They are
much too long to be described in full, but the following extract
will convey a notion of their character: "At a proper hour the
altars are covered over, and the hours are said, the candles
being extinguished on the altar until the beginning of mass.
In the meanwhile, fire is struck from a stone at the church-door,
and coals kindled with it. The none being said, the
priest, putting on his amice, alb, girdle, stole, and violet pluvial,
or without his capsula, the attendants standing by him
with the cross, with the blessed water and incense, before the
gate of the church, if convenient, or in the porch of the church,
he blesses the new fire, saying, The Lord be with you; and the
attendants reply, And with thy spirit." Prayers follow. "Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56"> 56</span>
he blesses five grains of incense to be placed on the wax, saying
his prayer." After the prayer, incense is put in the censer,
and sprinkled with water. "Meanwhile, all the lights of the
church are extinguished, that they may be afterwards kindled
from the blessed fire." The candles are lighted with many
ceremonies. The incense having been previously blessed, "the
deacon fixes five grains of the blessed incense on the wax in
the form of a cross." This wax is then lighted. When "the
blessing of the wax taper" is finished, the prophets are read,
and the catechumens during the reading are prepared for baptism.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
These proceedings, in which the notion of the sanctity
of fire—a notion shared by Roman Catholics with Parsees
and others—is apparent, are particularly interesting, as showing
the community of sentiment and of rites between the
Church of Rome and her pagan predecessors.</p>

<p>In the instances hitherto given, the consecrated actions have
been performed by the whole body of believers for the benefit
of all. They are means by which their religious union among
each other is strengthened, as well as their relation to the
deity they worship solemnly expressed. But there is another
class of consecrated actions which benefit, not the congregation
or sect at large, but a particular individual for whose
advantage they are performed. There are certain moments in
the life of the individual at which he seems peculiarly to need
the protection of God. Were these moments suffered to pass
unobserved in a single case, it would appear as if he whose life
had been thus untouched by religion stood outside the pale of
the common faith, unhallowed and unblessed. And a total neglect
of all these periods, even among savages, is, if not altogether
unknown, at least so rare as to demand no special notice
in a general analysis of religious systems. With extraordinary
unanimity, those systems have pitched upon four epochs as
demanding consecration by the observance of special rites.
Two of them are thus consecrated wherever a definite religion
exists at all. The other two are generally consecrated, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57"> 57</span>
in their case exceptions more frequently occur. The four
moments, or periods of life to which I refer, are</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Birth.</li>
<li>2. Puberty.</li>
<li>3. Matrimony.</li>
<li>4. Death.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the first and fourth are never suffered to pass
without religious observances, or at least, observances which, by
their solemnity and indispensable obligation, approach to a
religious character. The second is usually marked by some
kind of rite in the case of males; in that of females it is often
suffered to pass unobserved. The third is always placed under
a religious sanction, except among savages of a very low order.</p>

<p>Let us proceed to illustrate these propositions in the case of
birth. The ceremonies attendant upon this event need not
take place immediately after it; they may be deferred some
days, weeks, or months; they will still fall under the same category,
as designed to mark the child's entry into the world.
Their form will naturally vary according to the state of civilization
of the nation observing them; but notwithstanding this
there is a strange similarity among them. In Samoa, for
instance, "if the little stranger was a boy, the umbilicus was
cut on a club, that he might grow up to be brave in war. If of
the other sex, it was done on the board on which they beat out
the bark of which they make their native cloth. Cloth-making
is the work of women; and their wish was, that the little girl
should grow up and prove useful to the family in her proper
occupation" (N. Y., p. 175). I have added Mr. Turner's observation
to render the nature of this ceremony plainer. It
appears hardly religious; yet when we consider the symbolical
means by which the end is sought to be attained, and that
among savages so rude as those of Polynesia religion would
have no higher practical aims than to make the boys good
warriors, and the women industrious cloth-makers, we may
admit that even this elementary rite has in it something of a
religious consecration. When secular objects are attained by
mystical ceremonials, which have no direct tendency to produce
the desired result, we may generally conclude that religious
belief is at the bottom of them. In the present instance this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58"> 58</span>
conclusion is still further strengthened by the description given
by the same author of a similar ceremony in another island of
the Polynesian group. There, when a boy is born, "a priest
cuts the umbilicus on a particular stone from Lifu, that the
youth may be <i>stone</i>-hearted in battle. The priest, too, at the
moment of the operation, must have a vessel of water before
him, dyed black as ink, that the boy when he grows up, may
be courageous to go anywhere to battle on a pitch-dark night,
and thus, from his very birth, the little fellow is consecrated to
war" (N. Y., pp. 423, 424). Here the religious nature of the
operation is explicitly proved by the presence of the priest, the
inevitable agent in such communications between God and man.
Another missionary to the same race—the Polynesian islanders—informs
us that among these people mothers dedicated their
offspring to various deities, but principally to Hiro, the god of
thieves, and Oro, the god of war. "Most parents, however,
were anxious that their children should become brave and
renowned warriors," and with this end they dedicated them, by
means of ceremonies beginning before parturition, and ending
after it, to the god Oro. The principal ceremony after birth
consisted in the priest catching the spirit of the god, by a peculiar
process, and imparting it to the child. Here again the presence
of the priest, and the formal dedication to a god—even
though he be a god of questionable morality—render the religious
element in the natal ceremonies of these very primitive
savages abundantly plain (N. M. E., p. 543).</p>

<p>Baptism, or washing at birth, is a common process, and is
found in countries the most widely separated on the face of the
earth, and the most unconnected in religious genealogy. Asia,
America, and Europe alike present us with examples of this
rite. It seems to be a rude form of it which prevails in Fantee
in Africa, where the father, on the eighth day after birth, after
thanking the gods for the birth of his child, squirts some ardent
spirits upon him from his mouth, and then pronounces his
name, at the same time praying for his future welfare, and
"that he may live to be old, and become a stay and support
to his family," and if his namesake be living, that he may
prove worthy of the name he has received (Asha, p. 226). A rite
of baptism at birth, says Brinton, "was of immemorial antiq<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59"> 59</span>uity
among the Cherokees, Aztecs, Mayas, and Peruvians," and
this rite was "connected with the imposing of a name, done
avowedly for the purpose of freeing from inherent sin, believed
to produce a spiritual regeneration, nay, in more than one instance,
called by an indigenous word signifying 'to be born
again'" (M. N. W., p. 128). Mexico possessed elaborate rites to
consecrate nativity. When the Mexican infant was four days
old it was carried naked by the midwife into the court of the
mother's house. Here it was bathed in a vessel prepared for
the purpose, and three boys, who were engaged in eating a
special food, were desired by the midwife to pronounce its name
aloud, this name being prescribed to them by her. The infant,
if a boy, carried with it the symbol of its father's profession;
if a girl, a spinning-wheel and distaff, with a small basket and
a handful of brooms, to indicate its future occupation. The
umbilical cord was then offered with the symbols; and in case
of a male infant, these objects were buried in the place where
war was likely to occur; in case of a female infant, beneath the
stone where meal was ground.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The above statements rest on
the authority of Mendoza's collection. A still more complete
narrative of these baptismal ceremonies is given by Bernardino
de Sahagun, who records the terms of the prayers habitually
employed by the officiating midwife. Their extreme interest to
the study of comparative religion will justify me in extracting
some of them, the more so as they have never (so far as I am
aware) been published in English.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Suppose that the infant to be baptized was a boy. After the
symbolical military apparatus had been prepared, and all the
relatives assembled in the court of the parents' house, the midwife
placed it with the head to the East, and prayed for a blessing
from the god Quetzalcoatl and the goddess of the water,
Chalchivitlycue. She then gave it water to taste by moistening
the fingers, and spoke as follows: "Take, receive; thou seest
here that with which thou hast to live on earth, that thou
mayest grow and flourish: this it is to which we owe the necessaries
of life, that we may live on earth: receive it." Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60"> 60</span>upon,
having touched its breast with the fingers dipped in
water, she continued: "Omictomx! O my child! receive the
water of the Lord of the world, which is our life, and by which
our body grows and flourishes: it is to wash and to purify; may
this sky-blue and light-blue water enter thy body and there
live. May it destroy and separate from thee all the evil that
was beginning in thee before the beginning of the world, since
all of us men are subject to its power, for our mother is Chalchivitlycue."
After this she washed the child's whole body with
water, and proceeded to request all things that might injure him
to depart from him, "that now he may live again, and be born
again: now a second time he is purified and cleansed, and a
second time our mother Chalchivitlycue forms and begets him."
Then lifting the child in both hands towards the sky, she said:
"O Lord, thou seest here thy child whom thou hast sent to
this world of pain, affliction, and penitence: give him, O Lord,
thy gifts and thy inspiration, for thou art the great God, and
great is the goddess also." After this she deposited the infant
on the ground, and then raising it a second time towards the
sky, implored the "mother of heaven" to endow it with her
virtue. Next, having again laid it down, and a third time lifted
it up, she offered this prayer: "O Lords, the gods of heaven!
here is this child; be pleased to inspire him with your grace
and your spirit, that he may live on earth." After a final depositing
she raised him a fourth time towards the sky, and in
a prayer, addressed to the sun, solemnly placed him under the
protection of that deity. Taking the weapons she proceeded
further to implore the sun on his behalf for military virtues:
"Grant him the gift that thou art wont to give thy soldiers,
that he may go full of joy to thy house, where valiant soldiers
who die in war rest and are happy." While all this was going
on, a large torch of candlewood was kept burning; and on conclusion
of the prayers the midwife gave the infant some ancestral
name. Let it be Yautl (which means <i>valiant man</i>): then
she addressed him thus: "Yautl! take thou the shield! take
the dart! for those are thy recreation, and the joys of the sun."
The completion of the religious office was signalized by the
youths of the village coming in a body to the house and seizing
the food prepared for them, which they called "the child's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61"> 61</span>
umbilicus." As they went along with this food they shouted
out a sort of military exhortation to the new-born boy, and
called upon the soldiers to come and eat the (so-called) umbilicus.
All being over, the infant was carried back to the house,
preceded by the blazing torch. Much the same was the process
of baptizing a girl, except that the clothes and implements
were suited to her sex. In her case, certain formularies were
muttered by the midwife during the washing, in a low, inaudible
tone, to the several parts of her body: thus she charged
the hands not to steal, the secret parts not to be carnal, and so
forth with each member as she washed it. Moreover, a prayer
to the cradle, which seems in a manner to personify the universal
mother earth, was introduced in the baptism of females (C.
N. E. b. 6, chs. 37, 38).</p>

<p>If from heathen America we turn to Asia, we find that in
the vast domain of the Buddhist faith the birth of children is
regularly the occasion of a ceremony at which the priest is
present (R. B. vol. i. p. 584,) and that in Mongolia and Thibet
this ceremony assumes the special form of baptism. Candles
burn, and incense is offered on the domestic altar; the priest
reads the prescribed prayers, dips the child three times, and
imposes on it a name (R. B. vol. ii. p. 320). A species of baptism
prevails also among the Parsees, and was even enjoined by
the Parsee Leviticus, the Vendidad. This very ancient code
required that the child's hands should be washed first, and then
its whole body (Av. vol. ii. p. xix—Vendidad, xvi. 18-20). The
modern practice goes further. Before putting it to the breast,
the Parsee mother sends to a Mobed (or priest), to obtain some
Haoma juice; she steeps some cotton in it, and presses this into
the child's mouth. After this, it must be washed three times in
cow's urine, and once in water, the reason assigned being that
it is impure. If the washing be omitted, it is the parents, not
the child, who bear the sin (Z. A., vol. ii. p. 551).</p>

<p>Slightly different in form, but altogether similar in essence,
is the rite administered by the Christian Church to its new-born
members. Like those which have been just described, it consists
in baptism; but it offers a more remarkable instance than
any of them of the tenacity with which the human mind, under
the influence of religious belief, insists upon the performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62"> 62</span>
of some kind of ceremony immediately after, or, at the most,
at no great interval after birth. Christian baptism was not originally
intended to be administered to unconscious infants, but
to persons in full possession of their faculties, and responsible
for their actions. Moreover, it was performed, as is well known,
not by merely sprinkling the forehead, but by causing the candidate
to descend naked into the water, the priest joining him
there, and pouring the water over his head. The catechumen
could not receive baptism until after he understood something
of the nature of the faith he was embracing, and was prepared
to assume its obligations. A rite more totally unfitted for administration
to infants could hardly have been found. Yet such
was the need that was felt for a solemn recognition by religion
of the entrance of the child into the world, that this rite, in
course of time, completely lost its original nature. Infancy took
the place of maturity; sprinkling of immersion. But while the
age and manner of baptism were altered, the ritual remained
under the influence of the primitive idea with which it had been
instituted. The obligations could no longer be undertaken by
the persons baptized; hence they must be undertaken for them.
Thus was the Christian Church landed in the absurdity—unparalleled,
I believe, in any other natal ceremony—of requiring
the most solemn promises to be made, not by those who were
thereafter to fulfil them, but by others in their name; these
others having no power to enforce their fulfillment, and neither
those actually assuming the engagement, nor those on whose
behalf it was assumed, being morally responsible in case it
should be broken. Yet this strange incongruity was forced upon
the Church by an imperious want of human nature itself; and
the insignificant sects who have adopted the baptism of adults
have failed, in their zeal for historical consistency, to recognize
a sentiment whose roots lie far deeper than the chronological
foundation of Christian rites, and stretch far wider than the
geographical boundaries of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>The intention of all these forms of baptism—that of Ashantee
perhaps excepted—is identical. Water, as the natural means
of physical cleansing, is the universal symbol of spiritual purification.
Hence immersion, or washing, or sprinkling, implies
the deliverance of the infant from the stain of original sin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63"> 63</span>
The Mexican and Christian rituals are perfectly clear on this
head. In both, the avowed intention is to wash away the sinful
nature common to humanity; in both the infant is declared
to be born again by the agency of water.</p>

<p>Another ceremony very frequently practised at the birth of
children is circumcision. The wide-spread existence of this rite is
one of the most remarkable facts in comparative religious history.
We know from Herodotus, that it was practised by the
Colchians, Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Phœnicians (Herod., ii.
104). It has been found in modern times, not only in many
parts of Africa—to which it may have come from Egypt—but
in the South Sea Islands and on the American continent. Thus,
according to Beecham, there are "some people," among the
Gold Coast Africans, who circumcise their children (Asha, p.
225), though what proportion these circumcisers bear to the rest
of the population, he does not inform us. Another traveler describes
the mode of circumcising infants in the Negro kingdom
of Fida or Juda, a country to which he believes that Islamism
has not penetrated (V. G. vol. ii. p. 159). The operation is very
simple, and appears to be done without any religious ceremony;
but the natives, when pressed as to the reason of the custom,
can only reply that their ancestors observed it—an answer
which would properly apply to a rite of religious origin whose
meaning has been forgotten. Acosta, in his account of Mexican
baptism, adds that a ceremony which in some sort imitated the
circumcision of the Jews, was occasionally performed by the
Mexicans in their baptism, principally on the children of kings
and noblemen. It consisted in cutting the ears and private
members of male infants (H. I., b. 5, ch. 26 No. 2). That the
Jews circumcise their male children on the eighth day I need
not state. The rite is performed with much solemnity, and is
connected, as is common in these ceremonies, with the bestowal
of a name on the child, the name being given by the father
after the operation is over. Although circumcision is a ceremony
which usually applies only to boys, and although it sometimes
happens that the birth of girls is not marked like that of
boys by any religious rite, yet the Jews do not omit to consecrate
their female children as well as those of the stronger sex,
though with less solemnity. "The first Saturday after the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64"> 64</span>
of the month" of the mother's lying-in, she goes to the synagogue
with her friends, where "the father of the girl is called
up to the law on the altar, and there after a chapter hath been
read to him as usual on the Sabbath morning, he orders the
reader to say a Mee-Shabeyrach," or a prayer for a blessing (Rel.
of Jews, p. 27 1st part).</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, after these instances, to describe the various
modes of consecrating the commencement of life which are
in use in other countries. Enough has been said to show how
general, if not how universal, such consecrating usages are;
how religion, supported by the sentiment of mankind, seizes
upon the life of the individual from the first moments of his
existence; and demands, as one of the very earliest actions to
be performed on his behalf, a solemn recognition of the fact
that he stands under the influence, and needs the protection, of
an invisible and superhuman power.</p>

<p>After birth, the next marked epoch in life is the arrival at
manhood or at womanhood. The transition from infancy to
maturity, from dependence on others to self-dependence, from
an unsexual to a sexual physical and mental condition, has,
like the actual entrance upon life and departure from it, been
appropriated by religion with a view to its consecration by fitting
rites. Since there is no precise time at which the boy can
be said to become a youth, or the girl a maiden, the age at
which the ceremonies attending puberty are performed varies
very considerably in different countries. The range of variation
is from eight to sixteen, though there are exceptional cases both
of earlier and later initiation into the new stage of existence.
Generally speaking, however, these ages are the limits within
which the religious solemnities of puberty are confined.</p>

<p>More clearly, perhaps, than any of those occurring at the
other crises of our lives, these solemnities are pervaded by
common characteristics. Primitive man in Australia, in America,
and in Africa, marks the advent of puberty in a manner
which is essentially the same. When we rise to the higher
class of religions, we find ceremonies of a different kind from
which the ruder symbolism of the savage creeds is absent.
But from the uniformity of the types of initiation into manhood
among uncivilized people, it is highly probable that the progen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65"> 65</span>itors
of the Aryan and Semitic races also, at some period of
their history, employed similar methods of rendering this epoch
in life impressive and remarkable. Two distinguishing features
characterize the rites of puberty—cruelty and mystery. There
is always some painful ordeal to be undergone by the young
men or boys who have attained the requisite age; and this
ordeal is to be passed through in extreme secrecy as regards
the opposite sex, and with a ceremonial of an unknown character,
which is hidden from all but the initiated performers.
Sometimes the puberty of women is also sanctified by religious
ceremonies, and these follow the same rules, except that the
female sex are not required to undergo such severe suffering
as is often inflicted upon men. While, however, the cruelty is
less, the mystery is the same. Men are not admitted to witness
the performances gone through, and these are conducted in
secluded places to which no access is allowed.</p>

<p>The meaning of these two features of the rites of puberty is
not difficult to divine. Young men enter at that age on a
period of their lives in which they are expected to display courage
in danger and firmness under pain. Hence the infliction of
some kind of suffering is an appropriate symbolical preparation
for their future careers. Moreover, the manner in which they
endure their agony serves as a test of their fortitude, and may
influence the position to be assigned to them in the warlike
expeditions of the tribe. But the primary motive, no doubt, is
the apparent fitness of the infliction of pain at an age when
the necessary pains of manhood are about to begin.</p>

<p>The explanation of the secrecy observed is equally simple.
A mysterious change takes place in the physical condition at
puberty, the generative functions, which are to play so large a
part in the life of the individual, making their appearance then.
It is this natural process to which the religious process bears
reference. Without doubt the rites performed stand in symbolical
relation to the new class of actions of which their subject
is, or will be, capable. It is this allusion to the sexual instinct—a
subject always tending to be shrouded in mystery—which
is the origin of the jealous exclusion of women from the rites
undergone by men, and of men from those undergone by
women. The members of each sex are, so to speak, prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66"> 66</span>
alone for the pleasures they are afterwards to enjoy together.
Religion, ever ready to seize on the more solemn moments of
our existence, seeks to consecrate the time at which the two
sexes are ready to enter towards one another on a new and
deeply important relationship.</p>

<p>Bearing these characteristics in mind, we may proceed to
notice a few of the ceremonies performed at puberty. Let us
begin with the most barbarous of all, those witnessed by Mr.
Catlin among the Mandans, a tribe of North American Indians
now happily extinct. The usual secrecy was observed about
the "O-kee-pa," as this great Mandan ceremony is termed, and
it was only by a favor, never before accorded to a stranger,
that Mr. Catlin was enabled to be present in the "Medicine
Lodge," where the operations were conducted. In the first
place a mysterious personage, supposed to represent a white
man, appeared from the west and opened the lodge. At his
approach all women and children were ordered to retire
within their wigwams. Next day the young men who had
arrived at maturity during the last year were summoned to
come forth, the rest of the villagers remaining shut up. After
committing the conduct of the ceremonies to a "medicine
man," this personage returned to the west with the same mystery
with which he had come. The young men were now kept
without food, drink, or sleep, for four days and four nights.
In the middle of the fourth day two men began to operate upon
them, the one making incisions with a knife in their flesh, and
the other passing splints through the wounds, from which the
blood trickled over their naked, but painted bodies. The parts
through which the knife was passed were on each arm, above
and below the elbow; on each leg, above and below the knee;
on each breast, and each shoulder. The young men not only
did not wince, but smiled at their civilized observer during this
process. "When these incisions were all made, and the splints
passed through, a cord of raw hide was lowered down through
the top of the wigwam, and fastened to the splints on the
breasts or shoulders, by which the young man was to be raised
up and suspended, by men placed on the top of the lodge for
the purpose. These cords having been attached to the splints
on the breast or the shoulders, each one had his shield hung to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67"> 67</span>
some one of the splints: his <i>medicine bag</i> was held in his left
hand, and a dried buffalo skull was attached to the splint of
each lower leg and each lower arm, that its weight might prevent
him from struggling." At a signal, the men were drawn
up three or four feet above the ground, and turned round with
gradually increasing velocity, by a man with a pole, until they
fainted. Although they had never groaned before, they uttered
a heart-rending cry, a sort of prayer to the Great Spirit, during
the turning. Having ceased to cry, they were let down
apparently dead. Left entirely to themselves, they in time
were able "<i>partly</i> to rise," and no sooner could they do
thus much than they moved to another part of the lodge,
where the little finger of the left hand was cut off with a
hatchet. But their tortures were not over. The rest of them
took place in public, and were perhaps more frightful than any.
The victims were taken out of the lodge, and, being each placed
between two athletic men, were dragged along, the men holding
them with thongs and running with them as fast as they
could, until all the buffalo skulls and weights hanging to the
splints were left behind. These weights must be dragged out
through the flesh, the candidates having the option of running
in the race described, or of wandering about the prairies without
food until suppuration took place, and the weights came off
by decay of the flesh. These horrors concluded, the young
men were left alone to recover as best they might. Mr. Catlin
could only hear of one who had died "in the extreme part of
this ceremony," and his fate was considered rather a happy
one: "the Great Spirit had so willed it for some especial purpose,
and no doubt for the young man's benefit" (O-kee-pa,
p. 9-32).</p>

<p>Nor were the Mandans alone on the American continent in
marking the entrance upon manhood by distinctive observances.
On the contrary, a writer of the highest authority on Red Indian
subjects, states that no young man among the native
tribes was considered fit to begin the career of life until he had
accomplished his great fast. Seven days were considered the
maximum time during which a young man could fast, and the
success of the devotee was inferred from the length of his
abstinence. These fasts, says Mr. Schoolcraft, "are awaited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68"> 68</span>
with interest, prepared for with solemnity, and endured with a
self-devotion bordering on the heroic.... It is at this
period that the young men and young women 'see visions and
dream dreams,' and fortune or misfortune is predicted from the
guardian spirit chosen during this, to them, religious ordeal.
The hallucinations of the mind are taken for divine inspiration.
The effect is deeply felt and strongly impressed on the mind;
too deeply, indeed, ever to be obliterated in after life." It
appears that they always in after life trust to, and meditate on,
the guardian spirit whom they have chosen at this critical
moment; but that "the <i>name</i> is never uttered, and every circumstance
connected with its selection, and the devotion paid
to it, are most studiously and professedly concealed, even from
their nearest friends" (A. R., vol. i. pp. 149, 150). Mystery is
certainly pushed to its highest point, when the name of the
spirit chosen at puberty, and the very circumstances of the
choice, are preserved as an inviolable secret within the breast
of the devotee.</p>

<p>New South Wales is distinguished by a ceremony which,
though far less severe than that of the Mandans, is nevertheless
sufficiently painful. "Between the ages of eight and sixteen
the males and females undergo the operation which they
term Gnanoong; viz., that of having the septum of the nose
bored to receive a bone or reed.... Between the same
years, also, the males receive the qualifications which are given
to them by losing one front tooth." The loss of a tooth is not
in itself a very serious matter, but the intention of the extraction
being religious, the natives contrive to get rid of it in the
most barbarous mode. The final event is led up to by a series
of performances of a more or less emblematic nature. One of
them, for instance, is supposed to give power over the dog;
another refers to the hunting of the kangaroo. There is the
usual mystery about some part of the proceedings. When the
boys were being arranged for the removal of the tooth "the
author [Collins] was not permitted to witness this part of the
business, about which they appeared to observe a greater degree
of mystery and preparation than he had noticed in either of
the preceding ceremonies." After this, some of the performers
in the rite went through a number of extraordinary motions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69"> 69</span>
and made strange noises. "A particular name, <i>boo-roo-moo-roong</i>,
was given to this scene; but of its import very little
could be learned. To the inquiries made respecting it no answer
could be obtained, but that it was very good; that the boys
would now become brave men; that they would see well and
fight well." When the tooth was to be taken out, the gum was
first prepared by a sharply-pointed bone; and a throwing-stick,
cut for the purpose with "much ceremony," was then applied
to the tooth, and knocked against it by means of a stone in the
hand of the operator. The tooth was thus struck out of the
gum, the operation taking ten minutes in the case of the first
boy on whom the author witnessed this process being performed.
After the tooth was gone, "the gum was closed by his friends,
who now equipped him in the style that he was to appear in
for some days. A girdle was tied round his waist, in which was
stuck a wooden sword; a ligature was bound round his head,
in which were stuck slips of the grass-gum tree." The boy
"was on no account to speak, and for that day he was not to
eat." The sufferers in this ceremonial did not long remain quiescent.
In the evening they had fresh duties to discharge.
"Suddenly, on a signal being given, they all started up, and
rushed into the town, driving before them men, women, and
children, who were glad to get out of their way. They were
now received into the class of men; were privileged to wield the
sword and the club, and to oppose their persons in combat;
and might now seize such females as they chose for wives."
The sexual import of the ceremony is clearly brought into view
by the last words of the writer. He adds that, having expressed
a wish to possess some of the teeth, they were given him by
two men with extreme secrecy, and injunctions not to betray
them (N. S. W., p. 364-374).</p>

<p>Another observer has described the same rite as performed
in a somewhat different manner, "by the tribes of the Macquarrie
district" farther north. When these tribes assemble
"to celebrate the mysteries of Kebarrah," as it is termed, all
hostility which may exist at the time is laid aside for the nonce.
"When the cooi or cowack sounds the note of preparation, the
women and children in haste make their way towards the
ravines and gulleys, and there remain concealed." The den<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70"> 70</span>tistry
of these tribes is less scientific than that of New South
Wales. The tooth is knocked out "by boring a hole in a tree,
and inserting into it a small hard twig; the tooth is then
brought into contact with the end, and one individual holds the
candidate's head in a firm position against it, whilst another,
exerting all his strength, pushes the boy's head forwards; the
concussion causes the tooth, with frequently a portion of the
gum adhering to it, to fall out." But this is not all the poor
boy has to endure, for while "some men stand over him, brandishing
their waddies, menacing him with instant death if he
utters any complaint," others cut his back in stripes, and make
incisions on his shoulders with flints. It is an interesting part
of these ceremonies, that the least groan or indication of pain
is summarily punished by the utterance, on the part of the
operators, of three yells to proclaim the fact, and by the transfer
of the boy to the care of the women, who are summoned to
receive him. If he does not shrink, "he is admitted to the
rank of a huntsman and a warrior" (S. L. A., vol. ii. p. 216-224).</p>

<p>In other parts of Australia, different ceremonies prevail.
Thus, in one of the districts visited by Mr. Angas, when boys
arrive at the age of fourteen or sixteen, they are "selected and
caught by stealth," and the hairs of their body are plucked
out, and green gum-bushes are placed "under the arm-pits and
over the <i>os pubis</i>." Among the privileges conferred on those
who have undergone this treatment, is that of wearing "two
kangaroo teeth, and a bunch of emu feathers in their hair."
More significant still is the permission to "possess themselves
of wives," which the young men now obtain. The "scrub-natives"
vary the initiation again. Among them the boy,
brought by an old man, is laid upon his back in the midst of
five fires which are lighted around him. An instrument, called
a <i>wittoo wittoo</i>, is whirled round over the fires, with the intention
of keeping off evil spirits. Lastly, "with a sharp flint, the
old man cuts off the foreskin, and places it on the third finger
of the boy's left hand, who then gets up, and with another
native, selected for the purpose, goes away into the hills to
avoid the sight of women for some time. No women are allowed
to be present at this rite" (S. L. A., vol. i. pp. 98, 99).</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the same continent, there are three stages to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71"> 71</span>
be passed on the road from boyhood to manhood. At the age
of twelve or fifteen the boys are removed to a place apart from
the women, whom they are not permitted to see, and then blindfolded.
Among some other ceremonies their faces are blackened,
and they are told to whisper, an injunction peculiarly characteristic
of the mysteriousness which is so constant a feature of
the rites of puberty. For several months this whispering continues,
and it is noteworthy, as a sign of the sexual nature of
these proceedings, that the place where the whispers have been
"is carefully avoided by the women and children." In the
second ceremony, which occurs two or three years later, "the
<i>glans penis</i> is slit open underneath, from the extremity to the
scrotum, and circumcision is also performed." After this second
stage, the <i>Partnapas</i>, as the youths are now styled, "are permitted
to take a wife." In the third ceremony each man has
a sponsor, by whom he is tatooed with a sharp quartz. These
sponsors, moreover, bestow on each lad a new name, which he
retains during the remainder of his life. Certain other performances
are gone through, such as putting an instrument termed
a <i>witarna</i> round the lads' necks, and then "the ceremony concludes
by the men all clustering round the initiated ones,
enjoining them again to whisper for some months, and bestowing
upon them their advice as regards hunting, fighting, and
contempt of pain. All these ceremonies are carefully kept from
the sight of the women and the children; who, when they hear
the sound of the <i>witarna</i>, hide their heads and exhibit every
outward sign of terror" (S. L. A., vol. i. p. 113-116).</p>

<p>Leaving Australia, let us pass to Africa, and call Mr. Reade
as a witness to some of the rites of puberty existing among the
savages of that continent. The following extract is doubly interesting,
as furnishing some account of the application to girls
of the general principles involved in these rites, and also as
supplying, in the author's opinion, that they are of a Phallic
nature, a confirmation of the conclusions we had reached from
a survey of the evidence as a whole:</p>

<p>"Before they are permitted to wear clothes, marry, and rank
in society as men and women, the young have to be initiated
into certain mysteries. I received some information upon this
head from Mongilomba, after he had made me promise that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72"> 72</span>
would not put it into a book: a promise which I am compelled
to break by the stern duties of my vocation. He told me that
he was taken into a fetich-house, stripped, severely flogged, and
plastered with goat-dung; this ceremony, like those of Masonry,
being conducted to the sound of music. Afterwards there came
from behind a kind of screen or shrine uncouth and terrible
sounds such as he had never heard before. These, he was told,
emanated from a spirit called <i>Ukuk</i>. He afterwards brought to
me the instrument with which the fetich-man makes this noise.
It is a kind of whistle made of hollowed mangrove wood, about
two inches in length, and covered at one end with a scrap of
bat's wing. For a period of five days after initiation the novice
wears an apron of dry palm leaves, which I have frequently seen.</p>

<p>"The initiation of the girls is performed by elderly females
who call themselves <i>Ngembi</i>. They go into the forest, clear a
place, sweep the ground carefully, come back to the town, and
build a sacred hut which no male may enter. They return to
the clearing in the forest, taking with them the <i>Igonji</i>, or
novice. It is necessary that she should have never been to that
place before, and that she fast during the whole of the ceremony,
which lasts three days. All this time a fire is kept burning
in the wood. From morning to night, and from night to
morning, a <i>Ngembi</i> sits beside it and feeds it, singing, with a
cracked voice, <i>The fire will never die out!</i> The third night is
passed in the sacred hut; the <i>Igonji</i> is rubbed with black, red,
and white paints, and as the men beat drums outside, she cries,
<i>Okanda, yo! yo! yo!</i> which reminds one of the <i>Evohe!</i> of the
ancient Bacchantes. The ceremonies which are performed in
the hut and in the wood are kept secret from the men, and I
can say but little of them. Mongilomba had evidently been
playing the spy, but was very reserved upon the subject. Should
it be known, he said, that he had told me what he had missing, the
women would drag him into a fetich-house, and would flog him,
perhaps till he was dead.</p>

<p>"It is pretty certain, however, that these rites, like those of
the Bona Dea, are essentially of a Phallic nature; for Mongilomba
once confessed, that having peeped through the chinks of
the hut, he saw a ceremony like that which is described in
Petronius Arbiter....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73"> 73</span></p>

<p>"During the novitiate which succeeds initiation, the girls
are taught religious dances—the men are instructed in science
of fetich" (S. A., p. 245-247).</p>

<p>The Suzees and the Mandingoes, tribes of Western Africa,
are distinguished by a rite which, so far as I know, is peculiar—the
circumcision of women. Both sexes, indeed, are circumcised
on reaching puberty, and in the case of the girls it is done
"by cutting off the exterior part of the clitoris." With a view
to this ceremony, "the girls of each town who are judged marriageable
are collected together, and in the night preceding the
day on which the ceremony takes place, are conducted by the
women of the village into the inmost recesses of a wood." Surrounded
by charms to guard every approach to the "consecrated
spot," they are kept here in entire seclusion for a month and a
day, visited only by the old woman who performs the operation.
During this close confinement they are instructed in the
religion of their country, which hitherto they have not been
thought fit to learn. A most singular scene is enacted at its
close. They return to their homes by night, "where they are
received by all the women of the village, young and old, quite
naked." In this condition they go about till morning, with
music playing; and should any man be indiscreet enough to
imitate Peeping Tom, he is punished by death or the forfeiture
of a slave. After another month of parading and marching in
procession (no longer nude) the women are given to their
destined husbands;—another plain indication of the nature of
these rites. In such veneration is this ceremony held among
the women of the country, that those who have come from
other parts, and are already in years, frequently submit to it to
avoid the reproaches to which uncircumcision exposes them.
Indeed, "the most vilifying term they can possibly use" is
applied by the circumcised female population to those who do
not enjoy their religious privileges (S. L., p. 70-83).</p>

<p>Puberty is recognized in much the same way among the
South Sea Islanders. Thus, in Tanna "circumcision is regularly
practised about the seventh year" (N. Y., p. 87). In
Samoa "a modified form of circumcision prevailed," which boys
of their own accord, would get performed upon themselves
about the eighth or tenth year (Ib., p. 177). It may be a faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74"> 74</span>
beginning of the religious ceremonies of this period of life that,
in the same island, when girls are entering into womanhood,
their parents invite all the unmarried women of the settlement
to a feast, at which presents are distributed among them. At
least it is worthy of remark that "none but females are present"
on these occasions (Ib., p. 184).</p>

<p>When we rise higher in the scale of culture, we no longer
find the painful rites by which savage nations mark the appearance
of the sexual instinct. The sacred ceremony of investiture
with the thread, which distinguished the twice-born classes
among the Hindus, was performed at this age. The code of
Manu is explicit on the subject. "In the eighth year from the
conception of a Brahman, in the eleventh from that of Kshatriya,
and in the twelfth from that of a Vaisya, let the father
invest the child with the mark of his class." In the case of
children who desire to advance more rapidly than usual in their
vocation, "the investiture may be made in the fifth, sixth, or
eighth years respectively. The ceremony of investiture hallowed
by the gayatri must not be delayed, in the case of a
priest, beyond the sixteenth year; nor in that of a soldier
beyond the twenty-second; nor in that of a merchant beyond
the twenty-fourth." Further postponement would render those
who were guilty of it outcasts, impure, and unfit to associate
with Brahmans (Manu, ii. 36-40).</p>

<p>Members of the kindred Parsee religion become responsible
human beings after they have been girt with the kosti, or
sacred girdle. The age at which this took place was formerly
fifteen; and after they had once put them on, the Parsees
might not remove their girdles, except in bed, without incurring
serious guilt. This regulation applied equally to both
sexes. Modern usage has advanced the investiture with the
kosti to a much earlier period. It takes place in India at
seven, and in Kirman at nine. In India, the child is held
responsible in the eighth or tenth year for one half of its sins,
the parents bearing the burden of the other half (Av., vol. i. p.
9; vol. ii. pp. 21, 22).</p>

<p>The young Jew "is looked upon as a man" at the age of
thirteen, and is then bound "to observe all the commandments
of the law." At this age he becomes "Bar-mizva," or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75"> 75</span>
son of the law; that is, he enters on his spiritual majority
(Picard, vol. i. ch. x. p. 82). Christian nations signalize the
advent of the corresponding epoch by admitting those who
attain it to the Sacrament of the Lord's supper, and to confirmation.
At puberty they are considered, like the young Parsees,
responsible for the sins which at their birth their sponsors
took upon themselves, and at puberty they are admitted, like
the Jews, to the full privileges of their faith, by being allowed
to partake in the mystic benefits conferred by the celebration
of the death of Christ in the Holy Communion.</p>

<p>After puberty the two sexes enter on a new relation towards
one another; and though the instinct by which this relation is
established is extremely apt to break loose from the control of
religion, yet the latter always attempts more or less energetically
to bring it within its grasp. This it does by confining the
irregular indulgences to which the sexual passion is prone
within the legalized forms of matrimony. To matrimony, and
matrimony alone, it gives its sanction; and accordingly it confers
a peculiar sacredness upon this form of cohabitation, by
the performance of ceremonies at its outset. Such ceremonies
are not indeed equally universal with those of birth and
puberty. Among savage and slightly civilized communities we
do not find them. But in all the great religions of the world
they are firmly established.</p>

<p>Little of a distinctively religious character is perceptible in
Major Forbes's account of marriage rites in the island of Ceylon.
Yet it is plain that Singhalese marriages do stand under
a religious sanction, for in the first place an astrologer must
examine the horoscopes of the two parties, to discover whether
they correspond, and then the same functionary is called upon
to name an auspicious time for the wedding. On the day of
its occurrence a feast is given at the bride's house, and "on the
astrologer notifying that the appointed moment is approaching,
a half-ripe cocoa-nut, previously placed near the board with
some mystical ceremonies, is cloven in two at one blow" (E. Y.,
vol. i. p. 326-332).</p>

<p>Turning from southern to northern Buddhism, we find Köppen
asserting that in Thibet and the surrounding countries,
marriage consists solely in the private contract, yet adding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76"> 76</span>
none the less the lamaist clergy find business to do in regard
to engagements and weddings. The priests alone know whether
the nativity of the bride stands in a favorable relation to that
of the bridegroom, and if not, by what ceremonies and sacrifices
misfortune may be averted; they alone know the day that
is most suitable and propitious for the wedding; they give the
bond its consecration and its blessing by burning incense and
by prayer (R. B., vol. ii. p. 321).</p>

<p>The Code of Manu is not very clear as to the sort of marriages
sanctioned by religion; some irregular connections apparently
receiving a formal recognition, though regarded with
moral disapprobation. The system of caste, moreover, introduces
a confusing element, since the nuptial rites are permitted,
by some authorities, to become less and less solemn as the
grade of the contracting parties becomes lower. This opinion
having been mentioned, however, the legislator adds, that "in
this Code, three of the five last [forms of marriage] are held
legal, and two illegal: the ceremonies of Pisachas and Asuras
must never be performed." Of the two prohibited forms, the
first is merely an embrace when the damsel is asleep, drunk, or
of disordered intellect; the second is when the bride's family,
and the bride herself, have been enriched by large gifts on the
part of the bridegroom. Strangely enough, this regulation does
not exclude the marriage called Gandharva, which is "the reciprocal
connection of a youth and a damsel, with mutual desire,"
and is "contracted for the purpose of amorous embraces, and
proceeding from sexual inclination." Nor does it forbid forcible
capture. But a little further on, the code encourages the more
regular modes of marrying by promising intelligent, beautiful,
and virtuous sons to those who observe them; and threatening
those who do not with bad and cruel sons. It is then stated
that "the ceremony of joining hands is appointed for those who
marry women of their own class, but with women of a different
class" certain ceremonies, enumerated in the Code, are to be
performed (Manu, iii. i. 44). It is probable that this Code was
never actually the law of any part of India; but it is none the
less interesting to see the legislator striving to bring the lawless
passions with which he is dealing under the supervision of
religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77"> 77</span></p>

<p>An elaborate blessing and exhortation, beginning with the
words "In the name of God," is appointed in the Zend-Avesta
for the nuptial ceremonial. While marriages among Jews and
Christians are, as is well known, inaugurated by solemn religious
rites, and all unions not thus consecrated are, at least by
the formal judgment of their respective creeds, pronounced unholy,
sinful, and impure.</p>

<p>Death, like marriage, is held among all religions but the
lowest to call for the performance of befitting rites. In these
it is usually noticeable that much regard is paid to the manner
in which the deceased is placed in the grave, this circumstance
indicating as a general rule some form of the belief in his continued
existence. Thus, Lieut.-Colonel Collins, describing the
burial of a boy in New South Wales, observes that "on laying
the body in the grave, great care was taken so to place it that
the sun might look at it as it passed, the natives cutting down
for that purpose every shrub that could obstruct the view. He
was placed on his right side, with his head to the N. W." (N. S.
W., p. 387-390).</p>

<p>If there is little trace among the rude population of this
colony of a religious ceremony at the interment, we find the
position of religion distinctly recognized by the natives of some
parts of Africa. Oldendorp tells us of the tribes with which he
was acquainted, that the funeral rites are performed by the
priests, who are richly rewarded for the service. Not only are
animals sacrificed at the graves, but in the case of men of
rank their wives and servants are (as is well known) slaughtered
to attend them (G. d. M., p. 313-317). In Sierra Leone, where
"every town or village, which has been long inhabited, has a
common burial-place," there is the usual attention to position
in the grave. "The head of the corpse, if a man, lies either
east or west; if a woman, it is turned either to the north or
south. An occasional prayer is pronounced over the grave, importing
a wish that God may receive the deceased, and that no
harm may happen to him." Moreover, there is a ceremony
which appears to be a sort of sacrifice to the manes. "A fowl
is fastened by the leg upon the grave, and a little rice placed
near it; if it refuse to eat the rice, it is not killed; but if it
eat, the head is cut off, and the blood sprinkled upon the grave;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78"> 78</span>
after which it is cooked, and a part placed on the grave, the
remainder being eaten by the attendants." A tribe called the
Soosoos "bury their dead with their faces to the west" (S. L.,
vol. i. pp. 238, 239).</p>

<p>Sometimes we meet with the opinion that the entire removal
of the deceased from his accustomed place of abode on earth
depends upon due attention to the rites of interment. A primitive
form of this wide-spread belief—which lingers as a survival
even in Christendom—is observable in Polynesia. In Samoa,
"in order to secure the admission of a departed spirit to future
joys, the corpse was dressed in the best attire the relatives
could provide, the head was wreathed with flowers, and other
decorations were added. A pig was then baked whole, and
placed upon the body of the deceased, surrounded by a pile of
vegetable food." The corpse is then addressed by a near relation,
who desires it with the property thus bestowed to make
its way into "the palace of Tiki," and not to return to alarm
the survivors. If nothing happened within a few days, the deceased
was supposed to have got in; but a cricket being heard
on the premises was taken as an ill omen, and led to the repetition
of the offering.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the same group of islands "more costly sacrifices"
were presented to the gods of the celestial regions. At
least at the interment of a chief it was customary for his wives
to sit down severally near his body, to be strangled, and then
buried along with him. "The reasons assigned for this are, that
the spirit of the chief may not be lonely in its passage to the
invisible world, and that by such an offering its happiness may
be at once secured" (N. M. E., pp. 145, 146).</p>

<p>Funeral ceremonies in Mexico were performed by priests and
monks, and varied in splendor according to the rank of the deceased.
Offices were chanted at the graves, and at the burial
of persons of quality slaves were killed to serve them in the
next world. Moreover, so sensible were the Mexicans to the
importance of religion in all states of being, that even the domestic
chaplain was not omitted; a priest being slaughtered to
accompany his lord in that capacity (H. I., b. v. ch. viii).</p>

<p>In Ceylon, a dying relative is taken to a detached apartment,
where he is placed with his head towards the East. After death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79"> 79</span>
the body is turned with the head towards the West, and in the
grave this position is preserved. Bodies of priests, and persons
of the highest rank, are burned, and during the process of cremation
the officiating priest "repeats certain forms of prayer."
The same functionary returns to deliver "some moral admonitions"
after seven days, when the friends revisit the pyre to
collect the ashes (E. Y., pp. 334, 335).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that in countries professing the
lamaistic form of Buddhism dead bodies are unceremoniously
exposed to the open air, and left as a prey to birds or dogs, the
mortality of the laity "forms, with their sicknesses, the richest
source of income for the priests." A great deal, says the author
from whom we draw this information, depends on the separation
of soul and body taking place according to rule; and it is
important that the spirit should not injure those who are left,
and should meet with a happy re-birth. The Lama therefore
attends the death-bed, takes care to place the deceased in the
correct position, and observes the hour of departure. An operation
is then performed on the skin of the head, which is supposed
to liberate the soul. What rites are now to be performed,
how the body is to be disposed of, towards what quarter
it is to be turned, and various other details, depend on astrological
combinations known only to the clergy. But their most
important and profitable business is the repetition of masses,
for the dead, which are designed to pacify the avenging deities,
and to help the soul towards as favorable a career as is possible
for it. The length of time during which these masses are
said varies with the wealth of the survivors; poor people obtaining
them for a few days only; the richer classes for seven
weeks; and princes being able to assist the spirits of their relations
for a whole year (R. B., vol. ii. p. 323-325).</p>

<p>Among the Parsees the cemeteries consist of desolate, open
places, on which the corpses are deposited and left exposed to
the air. These places are called Dakhmas, and are carefully
consecrated by the priests with an elaborate ceremonial. The
position of the dead in the Dakhmas is fixed by the religious
law. Their dying moments and those that succeed upon death
are watched over by the Parsee faith, which has determined
the prayers to be repeated during the last hour of life; before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80"> 80</span>
the body is placed upon the bier; when it is carried out; on
the way to the Dakhma, and at the Dakhma itself. The ceremonies
required on these occasions must be performed by the
Maubads, or priests. But the due disposal of the body by no
means concludes the duties of relations towards the dead. The
welfare of the soul also demands numerous prayers. Being
supposed to linger for three days in the immediate neighborhood
of the corpse, it is the object during that time of especial
attention, and the rites then performed may be of use to it in
the judgment which takes place on the fourth day. Prayers
are to be recited, and offerings made on the 30th and 31st day
after death, and even then the ceremonies attending the close
of mortal existence are not concluded, for it is necessary after
the lapse of a year again to celebrate the memory of the departed.
Moreover, the 26th chapter of the Yasna, a hymn of
praise and blessing, is to be said every day during the year
before eating (Av. vol. ii. p. xxxii-xlii).</p>

<p>Masses for the dead are no less common in Christian countries
(save where the Protestant faith is professed), than among
Buddhists and Parsees. Their object also is precisely the same;
namely, the welfare of the soul which has quitted its earthly
home to enter on a new form of being. And although no such
prayers are repeated in Protestant communities, yet there can
be no doubt that interment in due form, and with due solemnity,
is held by the people, even in England, to benefit the
soul in some undefined way. Nor is any portion of the ritual
of the English Church more impressive than that passage in the
Burial Service where the officiating priest consigns "earth
to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>But it is not only the due performance of these last rites
which popular opinion associates with the prospect of salvation
in the world to come. As in other religions, so in that of our
own country, the position of the body in the tomb is deemed
to be of vast importance. The head must be westward and the
feet eastward, the nominal reason being that the dead person
should rise from his temporary abode with his face to the east,
whence Christ will come; the real reason being in all probabil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81"> 81</span>ity
the survival of a much older custom, in which that venerable
divinity, the Sun, stood in the place of the Savior of mankind.</p>

<small>CONSECRATED PLACES.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Consecrated actions of various kinds being the primary
method of approaching the beings in whose honor they are
performed, there remain various secondary methods; sometimes
tending to heighten the effect of the primary method, sometimes
supplementing it. These secondary means of giving effect
to the religious sentiment may be divided into three classes:—the
consecration of places, of things, and of persons; while the
last of these falls into two subdivisions: the self-dedication of
certain individuals to their deity, and the dedication of a certain
class to the more special performance of religious services on
behalf of the community.</p>

<p>Consecration of places evidently confers on the actions performed
within them a higher sanctity. Prayer offered in a place
which has been devoted to the service of God is more likely to
be successful. Praise from within its walls will be more acceptable.
Wedlock contracted under its influence will be more solemn,
and will possess a more binding character. Children may
most fitly enter upon life by a profession of faith made in their
behalf in a consecrated temple. And the bodies of the dead
will rest more peacefully in consecrated earth.</p>

<p>It is scarcely needful to offer evidence of the fact that in
various lands, and by many kinds of belief, the performance of
certain ceremonies is held to consecrate places to the purpose
of communication between man and the higher powers. From
the savage in Sierra Leone, where "a small shed of dry leaves"
presents perhaps the rudest form of temple to be found on
earth (S. L., p. 65), to the European who worships his God in
St. Peter's or Westminster Abbey, the same opinion prevails.
Everywhere the consecration of places is conceived to render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83"> 83</span>
them fitter for the celebration of religious rites, and unfit for
all profaner uses.</p>

<p>Of the state of feeling with which such localities are endowed
by the ordinary worshiper, an excellent example is offered in
Solomon's speech at the dedication of the temple. He specially
requests Jehovah that when prayers are made to him in this
place, or toward this place, he will hear such prayers: that is,
he expects that the sanctity he will confer upon the temple, by
devoting it to Jehovah, will add something to the efficacy of
petitions in which it is in some way concerned. The manner
in which he dedicates the temple may serve, too, as a type of
this kind of ceremony. "Solomon," we are told, "offered a
sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto the Lord, two-and-twenty
thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand
sheep." With this barbaric magnificence he "dedicated
the house of the Lord," and he subsequently hallowed the
middle of the court by "burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings,
and the fat of the peace-offerings" (1 Kings viii). How great
was the respect attached to this temple by the Israelites, and
how anxiously they sought to guard it against such profanation
as it received at the hands of Pompey, is well known.</p>

<p>The lavish splendor with which Solomon adorned his temple
is a common feature of consecrated places. Like the ancient
Hebrews, the Mexicans and Peruvians had buildings in honor
of their gods, of extreme magnificence. The temple of Pachacamac,
or the Creator, in Peru, was a very large and ancient
building, richly decorated, which was found to contain an
immense wealth of gold and silver vessels (H. I., b. v., chs. iii.,
xii). The boundless munificence with which pious Christians
have sought to beautify their places of worship needs no description.
Along with the more formal consecration given to
such sanctuaries of the Most High by special rites, they have
sought to render them more worthy of his habitation by the
liberality displayed in their erection and embellishment.</p>

<small>CONSECRATED OBJECTS.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Besides consecration of places to religious uses, material
things may be consecrated to the deity worshiped by those
who thus apply them. These things may be of the most varied
description, from common objects of the most trifling value, to
those of the utmost possible estimation. Among consecrated
objects are the furniture of temples or churches, which is
reserved for divine service; the garments worn by priests in
their liturgical functions; the votive tablets in which men
record their gratitude for preservation in danger; pictures,
statues, endowments of land for monasteries or the support of
ecclesiastical offices; and anything else which the owners may
part with from pious motives, and with the view of bestowing
it entirely on their god or his vicegerents on earth.</p>

<p>Such consecrated objects were seen in abundance by Lieutenant
Matthews in Sierra Leone, where the natives devoted
them to the idols who reigned in the small sheds of dry leaves
mentioned in the preceding chapter. The offerings made by
the natives to these superhuman beings consisted of "bits of
cloth, pieces of broken cups, plates, mugs, or glass bottles,
brass rings, beads, and such articles." But a still more precious
object was bestowed upon these gods by the people when
they wished to render them particularly complaisant. Then
"they generally provide liquor," of which they make a very
small libation to the object of their petitions and drink the
rest. Moreover, they have also little genii, or household gods,
consisting of images of wood from eight to twelve inches long,
to whom they consecrate certain things. These might be of a
very miscellaneous order. There might be seen, for instance,
"a brass pan fastened to the stump of a tree by driving a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85"> 85</span>
country axe through it—a glass bottle set up on the stump of
a tree—a broken bottle placed upon the ground with two or
three beads in it, covered with a bit of cloth, and surrounded
with stones—a rag laid upon small sticks and covered with a
broken calabash," and so forth. As in more civilized countries,
the sanctity conferred upon the objects by religion places
them under the special protection of the law. "To remove one
of them even unknowingly," continues the author, "is a great
offense, and subjects the aggressor to a <i>palaver</i>, or action in
their courts of law" (S. L., p. 65-67). The Tartar chiefs, as
described by the traveler Carpin, kept idols in their places of
abode, to whom they offered not only the first milk of their
ewes and mares, and something of all they ate, but to whom
they even consecrated horses. After this dedication to the idol
no one might mount these horses (Bergeron, Voyage de Carpin,
p. 30). Among the Singhalese a curious mode prevails of consecrating
fruit to some demon, in order to prevent its being
stolen. "A band of leaves" is to be seen fastened around the
stem of a fruit-tree, and it is supposed that no thief will be so
sacrilegious as to touch the fruit that has been thus hallowed.
"Occasionally," says Sir Emerson Tennent, "these dedications
are made to the temples of Buddha, and even to the Roman
Catholic altars, as to that of St. Anne of Calpentyn. This ceremony
is called Gokbandeema, 'the tying of the tender leaf,'
and its operation is to prevent the fruit from pillage, till ripe
enough to be plucked and sent as an offering to the divinity to
whom it has thus been consecrated." He adds, that a few only
of the finest are offered, the rest being kept by the owner (Ceylon,
vol. i. p. 540, 3d ed.). Another author, describing the same
custom, says, "To prevent fruit being stolen, the people hang
up certain grotesque figures around the orchards and dedicate
it to the devils, after which none of the native Ceylonese will
dare even to touch the fruit on any account. Even the owner
will not venture to use it, till it be first liberated from the
dedication. For this purpose, they carry some of it to the
pagoda, where the priests, after receiving a certain proportion
for themselves, remove the incantations with which it was dedicated"
(A. I. C., p. 198). Here the consecration, contrary to
the usual rule, is made with an interested motive, and is of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86"> 86</span>
nature of a direct bargain for temporal advantages. Of the
common form of consecration among the same people, another
visitor gives evidence; their temples are, he says, "adorned
with such things as the people's ability and poverty can afford;
accounting it the highest point of devotion, bountifully to dedicate
such things unto their gods, which in their estimation are
most precious" (A. R. C., p. 73).</p>

<p>Sometimes consecration is held to confer special powers, not
otherwise possessed, upon the objects on which it is performed.
Thus, among the rude Mongolians, the consecrating rites to
which sacred writings and images of Buddha are subjected are
described by a word meaning to <i>animate</i>, which is held by a
learned Orientalist to express their sense of the communication
of living power, of which the religious ceremony is the vehicle
(G. O. M., p. 330). Thus, too, among Christians, the consecration
of bread and wine by a priest is regarded as the means of
a still more extraordinary communication of living power to
those lifeless elements. And the writer has been present at the
Vatican when a vast number of rosaries, and other such trinkets,
were held up by a crowd of devotees to receive the Papal
blessing, which was evidently considered, by their owners, to
confer upon them some kind of virtue that was otherwise
lacking.</p>

<p>Naturally it follows from the theory of consecration—which
is that of a gift from men to God—that the more valuable the
objects given, the more pleasing will they be. Hence, men
generally endeavor to consecrate valuable objects, though
instances to the contrary may be found. The horses bestowed
by the Tartars were, no doubt, among their most precious possessions.
And the large endowments of land devoted in perpetuity
to the Church during the middle ages, were gifts of the
most permanent and most coveted form of property.</p>

<p>Consecration differs from sacrifice, in that the objects of sacrifice
are intended for the immediate gratification of the deity,
those of consecration for his continued use. Hence, things sacrificed
are consumed upon the spot; things consecrated are preserved
as long as their nature permits of it. So strong is the
sense of permanence attaching to consecration, that there are
probably even now persons among us, who would regard it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87"> 87</span>
a sort of crime for the State to assume the ownership of lands
once devoted to religious purposes, or to divert the proceeds to
some other employment. A like sentiment, no doubt, prevails
with regard to the material and the furniture of places of worship.
With regard to sacrifice the case is different. Animals,
fruits, or other articles intended for sacrifice, are given to the
god or his representative for the single occasion, and as a
requisite in the performance of some momentary rite. If a
homely comparison may be permitted on so sacred a subject, it
might be not inaptly said, that things sacrificed are like the
meat and drink placed before a guest who is invited to dinner,
while things consecrated rather resemble the present which he
carries away to his own residence, and keeps for the remainder
of his life.</p>

<small>CONSECRATED PERSONS</small>.</h3>
</div>

<p>We have seen the religious instinct leading to the consecration
of actions, to the consecration of places, and to the consecration
of things. We are now to follow it in a yet more striking
exhibition of its power, the consecration by human beings
of their own lives and their own persons (or sometimes of the
lives and persons of their children). Not only is such self-dedication
to the service of religion common; it is well-nigh universal.
There is no phenomenon more constant, none more
uniform, than this. Differing in minor details, the grand features
of self-consecration are everywhere the same, whether we
look to the saintly Rishis of ancient India; to the wearers of
the yellow robe in China or Ceylon; to the Essenes among the
Jews; to the devotees of Vitziliputzli in pagan Mexico; or to
the monks and nuns of Christian times in Africa, in Asia, and
in Europe. Throughout the various creeds of these distant lands
there runs the same unconquerable impulse, producing the same
remarkable effects. This is not the place to attempt a psychological
explanation of asceticism as a tendency of human nature.
We have now only to notice some of its most conspicuous
manifestations, and thus to assign to it its proper place in
a history of the mode in which man endeavors to approach and
to propitiate his god.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, we may premise that the consecration of
individuals to a life in which religion is the predominating element,
means the abandonment of the ordinary pleasures of the
world. This is of the very essence of self-devotion. Sanctity,
and the enjoyment of all those things in which the body is
largely concerned, have always been regarded as inconsistent
and opposite. Hence, in the first line of things prohibited to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89"> 89</span>
consecrated persons, we always discover the pleasures of sex.
To indulge in these is usually considered the most flagrant outrage
against their rules. Next to sexual delights, or equally
with them, the luxuries of choice food, rich clothing, comfortable
beds, well-furnished rooms, and similar ministrations to
physical ease are withheld from the votaries. They are very
frequently voluntary paupers or mendicants; or where this is
not the case, they usually depend on some endowment derived
from the liberality of others. Where their numbers are large,
they are placed under rules, and bound to the strictest obedience
to their superiors in the same line of life. Moreover, mere
abstinence from ordinary pleasures is not enough to prove their
devotion; they are called on to undergo extraordinary pains.
These vary with the rule of the order, or their own fervor.
Sometimes they are obliged to live in rooms which, in the coldest
weather, no fire is permitted to cheer; sometimes their
sleep is broken by rising at unseasonable hours to worship their
deity; sometimes the garment they wear is too thick in summer,
and too scanty in winter; and sometimes they tear their
own flesh by scourging and flagellation. Fasting, too, is often
imposed at certain times. And the zeal of individuals always
outruns the compulsory hardships of their position. They will
show the intensity of their devotion by fasting more rigorously
than others, sleeping on harder couches, bearing greater inflictions.
Self-consecration continually tends towards greater and
greater self-denial; but the actual degrees of self-denial vary
from the mere observance of some simple rules to the extremest
possibility of self-torture. Confining ourselves, however, to the
general marks which characterize this devotion of persons to
religion, we may say that it involves principally two things:
chastity and poverty.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards had established themselves in Mexico
and Peru, they were astonished to find, in the religious customs
and practices of the new world they had invaded, so much
that resembled those of the old world they had left behind.
Especially was this the case with regard to monastic institutions,
in respect of which it seemed that the Christian missionaries
had little to teach their heathen brothers. "Certainly it
is a matter of surprise," says the Reverend Father Acosta, "that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90"> 90</span>
false religious opinion should have so much power with those
young men and young women of Mexico, that they should do
with such austerity in the service of Satan that which many of
us do not do in the service of the most high God. Which is a
great confusion to those who are very proud and very well satisfied
with some trifling penance which they perform" (H. I., b. 5,
ch. 16, sub fine). In describing more particularly the manner in
which the devil had contrived to be served in Mexico, he states
that around the great temple there were two monasteries, one
of young women and the other of young men, whom they
called monks (religiosos). Those young men who served in the
temple of Vitziliputzli lived in poverty, chastity, and obedience;
ministered like Levites to the priests and dignitaries of the
temple, and had manual labor to do. Besides these were others
who performed menial services, and carried the offerings that
were made when their superiors went in quest of alms. All
these had persons who took charge of them, and when they
went abroad they held their heads low and their eyes on the
ground, not daring to raise them to look at the women they
might come across. Should they not receive enough by way of
alms, they had the right of going to the sown fields, and plucking
the ears of corn of which they had need. They practised
penance, rising at midnight, and also cutting themselves so as
to draw blood; but this exercise and penance did not last more
than a year (H. I., b. 5, ch. 16).</p>

<p>Both in Mexico and in Peru young girls were consecrated to
a religious life, but this consecration was sometimes only temporary;
a certain proportion of the Peruvian nuns being drafted
off into the harem of the Inca. Acosta, describing this consecration
of virgins, is again impressed with the abilities of the
devil. Since, he observes, the religious life is so pleasing in the
eyes of God, the father of lies has contrived, not only to imitate
it, but to cause his ministers to be distinguished in austerity
and regularity. Thus in Peru there were many convents for
girls, who were placed under the tuition of old women whom
they called Mamaconas. Indoctrinated by the Mamaconas in
"various things necessary for human life, and in the rites and
ceremonies of their gods," they were removed, after they had
attained fourteen years, either to the sanctuaries where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91"> 91</span>
preserved a perpetual virginity, or to be sacrificed in some
religious ceremonial, or to become wives and mistresses of the
Inca and his friends. The consecration of these damsels was
not, as usual in such cases, voluntary on their part, but the
same idea of merit inspired the gift on the part of those who
made it. For, while the surrender of female children to the
monastery was compulsory when demanded by an officer named
the "Appopanaca," yet "many offered their girls of their own
free will, it appearing to them that they gained great merit,
inasmuch as they were sacrificed for the Inca." If any of the
older nuns, who presided over the children, had sinned against
her honor, she was invariably buried alive or subjected to some
other cruel death.</p>

<p>"In Mexico," continues the pious Jesuit, "the devil also
found his own kind of nuns, although the profession did not
last more than one year." As has been said, there were two
houses, one for men and another for women. Like the monks,
the nuns also wore a distinctive costume, and dressed their
hair in a distinctive fashion. Like them, they had manual
labor to perform; like them, they rose at midnight for matins.
They had their abbesses, who occupied them in making robes
for the adornment of the idols. They also had their penance,
in which they cut themselves in the points of the ears. They
lived with honor and circumspection, and any delinquency,
even the smallest, was punished with death; for they said that
the sinner had violated the honor of their god (H. I., b. 5, ch. 15).</p>

<p>Another author, describing the religious orders of Peru,
states that fathers, anxious that their children's lives should be
preserved, used to dedicate them in infancy to some form of
monastic establishment, to which they were actually committed
at the age of fifteen. If, for instance, they were promised to
the house of Calmecac, it was that they might perform penance,
and serve the gods, and live in purity and humility and
chastity, and be altogether preserved from carnal vices. A
Christian parent could have desired no more. "And if it were
a woman, she was a servant of the temple called Civatlamacazqui;
she had to be subject to the women who governed that
order; she had to live in chastity, and abstain from every carnal
act, and to live with the virgins who were called <i>the sisters</i>,"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92"> 92</span>
who were shut up in the convent. A feast was made when the
child was dedicated by its parents, and the head of the order
took it in his arms in token that it was his subject till it was
married; the consecration not being perpetual. Its reception
was accompanied by a solemn ceremonial, in which the following
prayer was offered to their god: "O Lord, most merciful,
protector of all, here stand thy handmaidens, who bring thee a
new handmaid, whose father and mother promise and offer her,
that she may serve thee. And well thou knowest that the poor
thing is thine: vouchsafe to receive her, that for a few days
she may sweep and adorn thy house, which is a house of penance
and weeping, where the daughters of the nobles place
their hand on thy riches, praying and weeping to thee with
tears and great devotion, and where they demand with prayers
thy words and thy power. Vouchsafe, O Lord, to show her
grace, and to receive her: place her, O Lord, in the company
of the virgins who are called Tlamacazque, who do penance and
serve in the temple, and wear their hair short. O Lord, most
merciful, protector of all, vouchsafe to do with her whatever is
thy holy will, showing her the grace which thou knowest to be
suited to her." If then the girl was of age, she was marked in
the ribs and breast, in evidence of her being a nun; and if she
was still a child, a string of beads was put round her neck,
which she wore until she could fulfil the vow of her parents (A.
M., vol. v. p. 484-486).</p>

<p>But in addition to these temporary nuns, Peru had others,
whose vows were perpetual. Vega relates in his Commentaries,
that besides the women who entered into monasteries to profess
perpetual virginity, there were many women of the blood-royal
who lived in their own houses, subject to a vow of virginity,
though not in "clausura." They went out to visit their relations
on various occasions. They were held in the greatest
respect for their chastity and purity, which was by no means
feigned, but altogether genuine. Any failure to observe their
vow was punished by burning or drowning. The writer knew
one of these women when advanced in life, and occasionally
saw her when she visited his mother, whose great-aunt she
was. He bears witness himself to the profound veneration with
which this old lady was everywhere received, the place of honor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93"> 93</span>
being always assigned to her, as well by his mother as by her
other acquaintances (C. R., b. 4, ch. 7). Thus we find celibacy,
as a mark of piety, in full force in the new world at the time
of its discovery, no less than in the old; and religious chastity
as much respected by the idolatrous Mexicans and Peruvians as
by their Catholic invaders.</p>

<p>Monasticism, in countries where Buddhism reigns supreme,
is a vast and powerful institution. In the early times of Buddhistic
fervor, it would almost seem from the language of the
legends, that to embrace the faith of Sakyamuni and to become
an ascetic were one and the same thing. At least every convert
who aspired to be not only a hearer, but a doer of the word,
is described as instantly assuming the tonsure and the yellow
robe. At the same time the distinction between Bhikshus,
mendicants, and Upâsakas, laymen, is no doubt an early one;
and we must assume, that as soon as the religion of the gentle
ascetic began to spread among the people at large, those whose
circumstances did not permit them to be monks or nuns were
received on easier terms. "What," asked a disciple, "must be
done in the condition of a mendicant?"—"The rules of chastity
must be observed during the whole of life." "That is impossible;
is there no other way?"—"There is another, friend;
it is to be a pious man (Upâsaka)."  "What is there to be done
in this condition?"—"It is necessary to abstain during the
whole of life from murder, theft, pleasure (the illicit pleasures
of sex must be understood), lying, and the use of intoxicating
liquors" (H. B. I., p. 281). To these five commandments,
binding on every Buddhist, the rule imposed upon the mendicants
adds five more, to say nothing of many more special obligations
and regulations to which they are subject. Murder,
theft, unchastity, lying, and drinking, are forbidden to them as
to all others; the sixth commandment prohibits eating after
mid-day; the seventh singing, dancing, and playing musical
instruments; the eighth adorning the person with flowers and
bands, or using perfume and ointment; the ninth sleeping on
a high and large bed; the tenth accepting gold and silver.
These several prohibitions aim, as is evident, at precisely the
same objects which the founders of Christian orders have
always had in view; that, namely, of weaning their disciples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94"> 94</span>
from the world by keeping from them the enjoyment of its luxuries,
and preventing the acquisition of personal property.</p>

<p>The obligation to observe these rules commenced with the
novitiate; a condition which, in Buddhist as in Catholic communities,
precedes that of complete ordination. The novices
are termed Sramanera, a word meaning little Sramanas, while
the monks themselves are either Sramana or Bhikshu. Both
these designations serve to express the nature of their vocation;
Sramana being "an ascetic who subdues his senses," and
Bhikshu "one who lives by alms" (H. B. I., pp. 275, 276). The
sisters are called Bhikshunî, and they are said to owe their
origin to Maha Prajapati, the aunt of the great Sramana Gautama,
who obtained from her nephew, through the intercession
of the beloved disciple Ananda, the permission for her sex to
follow their brothers in the way of salvation by poverty and
chastity (Ibid., p. 278).</p>

<p>There can be no question that, according to the original
practice of the mendicant orders, the vow was taken for life;
and this is, I believe, still the custom in most of the lands
where Buddhism is in the ascendant. But in Siam, the monastic
vow can at any time be cancelled by the superior of the
monastery; and this rule, which involves a gross abuse of the
original institution, renders temporary asceticism universal in
that country (Wheel, p. 45). Another kind of degeneracy has
occurred in Nepaul, where the ministers of religion, who elsewhere
must be monks, are permitted to be married (Hodgson,
T.R.A.S., vol. ii. p. 245).</p>

<p>The objects proposed to themselves by Buddhists, in embracing
an ascetic life, are precisely the same as those proposed to
themselves by Christians. By denying themselves the pleasures
of this world, they hope to obtain a higher reward than other
mortals; whether in the shape of birth in a happier condition,
or in that of complete emancipation from all birth whatsoever,
which is the supreme goal of their religion. The means they
pursue to attain these ends are also similar. The Prâtimoksha
Sûtra, or Sûtra of Emancipation, which forms the universal
<i>regula</i> in all their monasteries, is worthy of a St. Benedict or a
St. Francis. It lays down with the minutest elaboration, not
only all the moral precepts that must be obeyed by the monk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95"> 95</span>
or nun, but all the little observances in regard to dress, eating,
walking, social intercourse, and so forth, to which he must
attend. It contains two hundred and fifty rules, and the breach
of any of these is attended with its appropriate penance,
according to the magnitude of the offense.</p>

<p>Asceticism was deeply rooted in the native land of Buddhism
long before the appearance of the reformer who gave it, by the
foundation of communities, an organization and a purpose.
Just as in Egypt there were many solitary saints before the
time of Pachomius and Antony, so in India there were holy
men who had subdued their senses before the gospel of deliverance
was preached by Gautama Buddha. Some of these dispensed
altogether with clothing, a custom which was frowned
upon by Buddhism and put down wherever its influence was
paramount. Others lived in lonely places, exposed to every
sort of hardship and avoiding every form of carnal pleasure.
The popular mind combined the practice of austerity with the
acquisition of extraordinary powers over nature. Hence, no
doubt, an additional motive for its exercise. The Râmâyana
abounds with descriptions of holy hermits, living on roots in
the forests, and practising the utmost austerity. Visvamitra,
for example, the very type of an ascetic, was a monarch, who
determined to obtain from the gods the title of "Brahman saint,"
the highest to which he, not by birth a Brahman, could aspire.
This was the manner in which he went to work:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">"His arms upraised, without a rest,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Twice did the gods, alarmed at the power he was likely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96"> 96</span>
acquire, direct their efforts against his chastity. The first time
the perfect nymph deputed on this errand, seen by him while
bathing herself naked in the stream, caused him to forget his
vow and dally with her for ten years. The second time the
saint perceived the plot, but allowed himself to burst forth in
words of unholy rage against the damsel who was trying to
seduce him, and thus lost the merit of his former penance.
After this he resolved never to speak a word, and persisted in
his resolution, until the gods, in a body, addressed him in the
long-desired form: "Hail, Brahman Saint" (Griffith, The
Ramayan, vol. i. p. 274).</p>

<p>Visvamitra is of course a mythical character, and his penance
imaginary; but the ascetic life he is described as leading
was taken from models which the writers had before their
eyes. All the marvels of the Thebaid in Christian times were,
in fact, anticipated in India by at least one thousand years.</p>

<p>How deeply the ascetic tendency is implanted in human nature
is strikingly shown in the case of the Essenes, the Nazarites,
and the Therapeutæ, who sprang from a religion whose
ostensible precepts are eminently opposed to all such courses,
that of the Jews. Judaism powerfully encouraged all those inclinations
to which monasticism is fatal: the propagation of
the species, the acquisition of property, the maintenance of
family ties, and the enjoyment of the good things which this
world has to offer. Yet from the bosom of this sober faith
sprang bodies of men who neither ate flesh, nor drank wine,
nor cohabited with women. It may be that the Jewish ascetics
were not very numerous; but it is clear, too, that they were not
so few as to be deemed by contemporary observers altogether
unimportant. And the fascination which John the Baptist, pre-eminently
an ascetic, exercised over his countrymen in the first
century, is a sign that this mode of living was conducive among
the Jews to that spiritual supremacy which is so constantly received
at the hands of Christians.</p>

<p>That Christianity should encourage a disposition which even
Judaism could not check was no more than might be expected
from the language and conduct of its founder and his earliest disciples.
Christ was never married, and probably lived in complete
chastity. Paul goes so far as to compare marriage unfavorably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97"> 97</span>
with celibacy. James upholds poverty as preferable to riches in
the eyes of God. The whole of the New Testament abounds with
passages in which present misery is declared to be the forerunner
of future happiness, and present prosperity of future suffering.
This is the very spirit of monasticism, and it is not surprising
that from such a root such fruits have sprung. From a
very early age devout Christians have felt that in renouncing
individual property, marriage, personal freedom, and the various
other joys which life in the world offers, they were fulfilling
the dictates of their religion and preparing themselves for
heaven. To illustrate this proposition effectually would be to
write the history of the monastic orders. Beginning in the deserts
of Egypt, these have extended throughout Europe, and
have exercised a vast and potent influence on the extension of
the Christian faith. Monks have been missionaries, preachers,
martyrs, persecutors, bishops and popes. The greatest names
who have ranged themselves under the banner of the Catholic
Church have belonged to one or other of the several orders.
And alongside of the monks, living by the same rule, helping
them in their several tasks, the nuns have ever been forward in
undergoing their share of austerity and undertaking their
share of labor.</p>

<p>Very various have been the immediate motives that have led
such large numbers of Christians to betake themselves to the
monastery or the convent. Some have fled from riches and
luxury; others from poverty and wretchedness. Some have been
sick of earthly pleasures; others have sought to avoid the
temptation of ever knowing them. Many have been drawn by
the irresistible spell of asceticism to flee from opposing parents
and unsympathizing friends in order to embrace it; others have
been destined from their infancy, like the Mexican and Peruvian
youth, to wear the cowl or to take the veil. But throughout
the history of every order there has been the same fundamental
idea sustaining its existence; the idea, namely, that in becoming
an ascetic, the person was consecrated to God, and became
by that consecration purer, holier, and better than those
who continued to pursue the ordinary avocations of secular life.</p>

<p>This consecration is not given without due solemnity. It is
only after a novitiate, in which he has full experience of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98"> 98</span>
privations to be undergone, that the candidate can be received
into the order of which he desires to be a member. Should his
resolution be unshaken after his year's trial as a novice, he
may take the irrevocable vow of obedience, under which those
of poverty and chastity are comprehended. He is now a consecrated
person. He has sacrificed himself completely to his
divine Master, and whatever reward he may hope to receive
must be given by that Master in a future state.</p>

<p>It is one of the principal weaknesses of Protestantism that
it has omitted to provide for the ascetic instinct. It has lost
thereby the mighty hold which the Catholic Church must ever
possess over those who feel themselves moved to crucify the
flesh and devote themselves wholly to spiritual things. Strange
to say, this remarkable instinct has nevertheless broken out
afresh within the bosom of Protestantism in recent times. The
Shakers are but a somewhat novel species of monks and nuns.
They abstain from marriage though the two sexes live together
in one community. Their chastity is said to be perfect. They
give up all individual property for the common good. They
wear a peculiar dress and are subject to peculiar rules. Lastly,
they believe that they stand under the special guidance and
protection of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<small>CONSECRATED MEDIATORS.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Having seen the manner in which individuals devote themselves
to the special service of their deities, we have now to
observe the further fact that a whole class of men is devoted
to this service by the demands of society. This class is the
priesthood. They differ from the persons last treated of, inasmuch
as the consecration of ascetics has reference exclusively
to their own personal salvation, while the consecration of priests
has reference exclusively to the salvation of others. A monk
or a nun becomes by the act of profession a holier being; less
occupied with the world; mentally nearer to God; better fitted
to communicate with him than ordinary unchaste mortals. A
priest becomes by the act of ordination a being endowed with
special powers; better entitled to offer up the public prayers
than others; more likely to be heard when he does so; more
eligible as a channel of communication between men and God
than unordained mortals. In other words, his functions are of
a public, those of the monk of a private, kind.</p>

<p>We must not be confused by the fact that among Buddhists
and among Catholics the two species of consecration are no
longer completely distinct, the monks in both of those great
religions being at the same time priests. The early writings of
Buddhism sufficiently evince the fact that no kind of public
ministry was at first connected with the profession of a mendicant.
He had simply to observe the precepts of his order, and
to aim at such perfection as should ensure the deliverance of
his soul. Priestly duties are now indeed performed by monks
in Buddhist countries, but this is an addition to their regular
vocation, not a necessary part of it; while in Catholic countries,
the ecclesiastical character which the monks at present enjoy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100"> 100</span>
in no way belonged to them when the monastic orders were
first established. The monks, as Montalembert observes, were
at first an intermediate body between laity and clergy, in whom
the latter were to see an ideal which it was not possible for all
to attain. Technically, however, the monks formed a part of
the laity, and the steps by which they came to be considered
as the "regular clergy" are, according to the same high authority,
difficult to follow (M. d'O., vol. i. p. 288; vol. ii. p. 57).
Self-consecration, and consecration to ecclesiastical duties were
therefore two very different things, and the distinction between
regular and secular clergy shows that, though somewhat obliterated
in appearance, the two ideas are still kept apart.</p>

<p>In all religions that have risen above the rudest stage, those
who desire to become priests are initiated by certain fixed ceremonies.
Thus is the consecration given which fits them to
convey to God the wishes of mortals, and to mortals the will
of God. To take an example from a very primitive form of
faith, the "Angekoks," or priests of the Greenlanders, receive
their commission only after long and exhausting rites, in which
a familiar spirit is supposed to appear to them, and to accompany
them to heaven and hell. Should they fail ten times in
obtaining the assistance of such a spirit, they are compelled to
lay down their offices. The spirit, when he comes, holds a conversation
with the Angekok, who is thus installed in his profession
by supernatural means (H. G., p. 253-256). So also,
among the American tribes in New France, we are told that
the "Jongleurs" by profession never obtained this character
till after they had been prepared for it by fasts, which they
carried to a great extent, and during which they beat the drum,
cried, shouted, sung and smoked. Their installation was subsequently
accomplished in a sort of Bacchanalia, with ceremonies
of a highly extravagant nature (N. F., vol. iii. p. 363). Among
a certain tribe of negroes, the priests are taken from a class of
men termed "living sacrifices" (G. d. M., p. 328), who live at
the expense of others, taking whatever they require, and who
wear their hair, like the Nazarites, unshorn. Here their consecration
is marked by these peculiar characteristics, and appears
to be impressed upon them by some dedication made without
their own consent. In another negro nation, there is a priestess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101"> 101</span>
of a certain snake, who is marked in a peculiar way over the
whole body, and held in great esteem. Every year some young
girls are seized by force and taken to this priestess, who marks
them artistically, initiates them in religious songs and dances,
marries them in a manner to the snake, and consecrates them
as priestesses of that divinity. With others again the priesthood
is hereditary, the consecration in this case being imprinted
once for all on certain families, and not imparted, as in the
instances given above, by rites affecting only the individual
who undergoes them. A peculiar modification of the hereditary
principle is where the preference is given to him, among
several sons, who dares to pull certain grains (which have been
previously put in) out of the teeth of his deceased father, and
place them in the mouth of the corpse. Here the consecration
is partly inherited, partly personal. Elsewhere a priest or
fetich-maker is made "by all sorts of silly ceremonies at a
meal," and a string with consecrated objects is hung round his
neck in token of his condition (G. d. M., p. 328).</p>

<p>Both principles, the hereditary and the personal, were known
in Mexico. The priests of Vitziliputzli succeeded by right of
birth; the priests of other idols by election or by an offering
made in their infancy. Priests were consecrated to their holy
office by an unction which, as Father Acosta justly observes,
resembled that of the Catholic Church. They were anointed
from head to foot, and the hair was left to hang down in tresses
moist from the application of the ointment. But when they
were going to perform the offices of their sacred calling on
mountains, or in dark caves, they were anointed with an altogether
different substance, compounded by a peculiar process
from certain venomous reptiles. This was supposed to give
them courage (H. I., b. 5, ch. 26).</p>

<p>The consecration of the Levitical priesthood, originally personal,
descended from father to son, and was moreover confined
to the members of this single tribe. It could not be repeated
after its first performance. Hence we have in this case an
interesting example, not only of an hereditary priesthood, but
also of the manner in which its exclusive sanctity was supposed
to have been originally established. Moses, who derived his
appointment directly from Jehovah, was employed to consecrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102"> 102</span>
Aaron and his sons by means of an elaborate and imposing
ritual communicated to him by that deity himself. The means
thus taken (in Jehovah's own words) "to hallow them, to minister
unto me in the priest's office," were effectual for all time;
the descendants of Aaron after that being priests by nature.
How great was the value of the consecration thus given, may
be seen by the fact that Moses was ordered to threaten the
penalty of death against any one who should dare to manufacture
oil similar to that used in anointing Aaron and his sons
(Exod. xxviii. 29; xxx. 30-33).</p>

<p>Priestly power among Christian nations is communicated in
a solemn ceremonial, and is conferred only upon the individual
recipient. It does not descend in his family, but it is capable
of being imparted by bishops, who have themselves received a
higher grade of priestly consecration. By some it is actually
supposed that a mysterious virtue, derived directly from Christ
through the apostles, is conveyed to the recipient of holy orders.
But whether the apostolical succession be conveyed or not in
the Ordination Service of the Church of England, it is certain
that a high authority is held to be given to the priest by the
laying on of the hands of the Bishop and of the other priests
present at the time.</p>

<p>The rights which he receives are thus expressed:—</p>

<p>"Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a priest
in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition
of our hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive they are forgiven;
and whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained, and
be thou a faithful dispenser of the Word of God, and of his
holy sacraments. In the name of the Father and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."</p>

<p>After this the Bishop delivers the Bible to each of the candidates,
saying:—</p>

<p>"Take thou authority to preach the Word of God, and to
minister the holy sacraments in the congregation where thou
shalt be lawfully appointed thereunto."</p>

<p>Here it may be observed that there are three powers conveyed
by this ordination: the power of preaching, the power
of administering the sacraments, and the power of forgiving
and retaining sins. Since the salvation of Christians depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103"> 103</span>
upon their admission to the sacraments, and upon the forgiveness
of their sins, it is obvious that the priest who may debar
them from the one, and refuse the other, receives in his consecration
the keys of the kingdom of heaven. In their communications
to the Almighty through the mediation of such priests,
men are in possession of an instrument of the very highest
efficacy.</p>

<p>The terrible reality which the belief in the ecclesiastical
privilege of forgiving sins may sometimes have, is graphically
exhibited in M. de Lamartine's touching poem entitled "Jocelyn."
Therein a bishop, taken prisoner and condemned to death
in the French Revolution, sends for a young deacon who was
living in concealment in the Alps with a maiden who loved him
deeply, and whom (since the irrevocable vows of a priest were
not yet taken) he intended to marry. Regardless of all his
pleading the Bishop, under the threat of his dying anathema,
forces the unhappy youth to receive priestly orders at his hands,
solely in order that he may then listen to the episcopal confession
and forgive the episcopal sins. Marriage was now rendered
impossible by the vow he had taken; and thus two lives were
consigned to enduring misery that a bishop might die in peace.
Surely the morality which could lead to such a consummation
is self-condemned!</p>

</div>


<p>We proceed now from the several methods by which men, in
all ages and in all countries, have sought to convey their
wishes, aspirations, and emotions upwards, to those by which
their several deities have in their opinion conveyed their commands,
decisions, and intentions downwards. The classification
will follow as closely as the subject permits that of the preceding
part. Consecration, the quality pertaining to man's instruments
of communication with God, will be replaced by
holiness, the quality pertaining to God's instruments of communication
with man. Thus, corresponding to the consecrated
actions of prayer, sacrifice, and praise, we shall have the holy
events of omens, signs, miracles, and so forth. Corresponding
to the consecrated places where men pay their devotions, we
shall find the holy places which some higher being has blessed
with tokens of his presence. Corresponding to the consecrated
objects bestowed by the creature on the Creator, we shall discover
holy objects through which some peculiar grace is conveyed
by the Creator to the creature. To consecrated men will
correspond holy men, who speak to their fellows with an authority
higher than their own; and these holy men will fall
into two classes, those whose regular work it is to represent the
deity on earth and those who are sent on some special occa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105"> 105</span>sion
for some special purpose. Lastly, a separate division
(having no correlative among means of communication upwards)
must be given to holy books, for a most important place
in the history of religions is occupied by treatises written by
the gods for the use of men. To these then the final chapter
of this portion of the work must be devoted. Pass we now to
holy events.</p>

<small>HOLY EVENTS.</small></h3>
</div>

<p>Manifold beyond the possibility of complete computation
are the signs and intimations vouchsafed to the ignorance and
weakness of man by the celestial powers. They speak to him
through the ordinary phenomena of nature; they instruct him
through her rare and more striking exhibitions; they guide his
footsteps through prodigies and marvels. Sometimes addressing
him spontaneously, without any attempt on his part to
elicit their intentions, they open their views or announce the
future; sometimes replying to his anxious inquiries, they point
out the truth and relieve his perplexity. Consider first the
former class of divine manifestations, in which the human
being is a merely passive recipient of the communication
granted.</p>

<p>Dreams are an excellent example of this class of events. The
belief that they are of supernatural origin is both wide-spread
and ancient. Possibly there is no country in which it has not
been held to a greater or less extent, even though it may not
have formed an article in the established creed. Among the
Africans in and about Sierra Leone, for example, a dream is
received as judicial evidence of witchcraft, and the prisoner accused
on this slender testimony "frequently acknowledges the
charge and submits to his sentence without repining" (N. A.,
vol. i. p. 260). On the American continent, where dreams (says
Charlevoix) "are regarded as true oracles and notices from
heaven" (H. N. F., vol. iii. p. 348), it is plain that the like faith
in their intimations prevails. Although explained in a variety
of ways, now as the rational soul going abroad, while the sensitive
soul remained behind, now as advice from the familiar
spirits, now as a visit from the soul of the object dream pt of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107"> 107</span>
the dream is always regarded as a sacred thing. It was thought
to be the most usual way taken by the gods of making their
wills known to men. Hence they took care to obey the intimations
given in dreams; a savage who had dreamt that his little
finger was cut off actually submitting to that operation; and
another, who had found himself in his dream a prisoner among
enemies, getting himself tied to a stake and burnt in various
parts of the body (H. N. F., vol. iii. pp. 353, 354). The Jews
have in their ritual a singular ceremony for removing the influence
of bad dreams. The person who has dreamt something
which seems to portend evil, is said to choose three friends, and
standing before them as they sit, to repeat seven times: "A
good dream have I seen." To which they reply: "A good dream
thou hast seen; it is good and shall be good; the compassionate
God, who is good, make it good." And the conversation
between the dreamer and the interpreters continues for some
time, the general effect being to convey God's blessing to the
former and convert his trouble into gladness. At the end the
interpreters say: "Go eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy
wine with a cheerful heart, for God now accepteth thy works.
And penitence and prayers and righteousness will set aside the
evil that hath been doomed, and peace be unto us and unto all
Israel, Amen." To this the author of the book appends the
remark that "the Jews believe that all dreams come to pass
according to the interpretation that is made of them," for which
reason they relate their dreams to none but friends (Rel. of
Jews, p. 71-74). But that they can believe it to be in the power
of their friends to <i>change</i> the meaning of the dream by an arbitrary
interpretation seems scarcely possible. It may, therefore,
be the meaning of this passage that an unfavorable interpretation
is in itself ominous of misfortune, or that they are desirous
not to hear the worst construction that can be put upon a
dream.</p>

<p>Belief in the prophetic signification of dreams is not only not
discountenanced by the Christian religion, but is explicitly
taught by it. If in the present age this belief has fallen somewhat
out of repute, this is not because there can be any doubt
that the inspired writers of the Christian Scriptures firmly held
it, but is a feature of the general relaxation of the bonds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108"> 108</span>
dogma which characterizes the modern mind. To take a few
instances: when Abraham had called Sarah his sister, and thus
permitted the king of Gerar to appropriate her, God himself
came to Abimelech by night in a dream, and told him that she
was a married woman (Gen. xx. 3). Highly important information
as to the future of his race was given to Jacob in a dream
(Gen. xxviii. 11-15). His son Joseph enjoyed an extraordinary
faculty, not only of dreaming true dreams himself, but also of
interpreting the dreams of others. It was his own prophetic
dreams which led to his sale into the hands of the traders by
his brothers, and it was his power of correct interpretation
which both freed him from his prison in Egypt, and led to his
promotion to the high office he afterwards held at the Egyptian
court (Gen. xxxvii., 5-11; Gen. xl., xli). Moreover, Joseph, who
must be considered an authority on the subject, expressly
informed Pharaoh, when that monarch had related his dreams
that God had showed him what he was about to do (Gen. xli.
25-28). A most important dream was granted to Solomon, to
whom "the Lord appeared in a dream by night," and told him
to ask whatever favor he might wish: on which occasion the
king preferred his celebrated request for wisdom (1 Kings iii., 5-15).
Another ruler, Nebuchadnezzar, was also visited by a prophetic
dream, the nature of which was revealed to the interpreter,
Daniel, "in a night vision," by God himself, who thus admitted
that it was he who had sent it. A further communication
was made to Nebuchadnezzar, in the dream which he himself
has recorded in the proclamation which bears witness at the
same time to the fulfillment of its warning (Daniel ii., iv). But
of all the dreams handed down to us by the Scriptural writers,
by far the most material, as evidence of their Divine character,
is that on which the mystery of the Incarnation mainly rests.
Take away the dream in which Joseph was informed that the
Holy Ghost was the parent of Mary's first-born child (Matt. i.
20), and that mystery will depend exclusively on a story of an
angel's visit, of necessity related by Mary herself (Luke i. 35);
for obvious reasons not the most trustworthy witness on so delicate
a point. But this is not all; for it was by a dream that
the Magi, after their adoration, were warned to escape the vengeance
of Herod (Matt. ii. 12); and by a dream that the life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109"> 109</span>
the infant Christ was preserved in the massacre of the innocents
(Matt. ii. 13). Christianity, therefore, may be said to owe
its very existence to the celestial intimations conveyed in
dreams, and Christians cannot consistently embrace any theory
which would lead to a denial of their holy and prophetic character.
Since, moreover, we have numerous instances in the
Bible of such dreams being granted to heathens and idolaters
it is plain that the Christian deity does not confine his nocturnal
visitations to orthodox believers. If the chief butler, the
chief baker, Pharaoh, and Nebuchadnezzar dreamt prophetically,
so may any of us at any time according to this teaching.
On the other hand, this power may be due to a special outpouring
of the Holy Spirit, as implied in the prediction of Joel
that "your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your old
men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions"
(Joel ii. 28). So that we may completely endorse the conclusion
of the Rev. Principal Barry, who discusses this subject with
much solemnity in Smith's "Dictionary of the Bible," "that
the Scripture claims the dream, as it does every other action of
the human mind, as a medium through which God may speak
to man, either directly, that is, as we call it, 'providentially,'
or indirectly, in virtue of a general influence upon all his
thoughts; but whether there is anything to be said in support
of the further inference that 'revelation by dreams' may be
expected to pass away, is not equally clear." Assuredly no passage
can be produced which, even by implication, states that
this method of communication was temporary or transient; and
considering that it continued in operation from the days of
Abraham to those of Jesus, it is hard to see how the Bible can
be made to support the notion that it is to cease entirely at
any period of human history. On the contrary, the Scriptural
writers, both old and new, would practically have agreed with
Homer: "The dream also is from Zeus" (Iliad, i. 63). Indeed,
the passage in which that deity sends the personified Dream to
bear a message to Agamemnon (Ibid., ii. 8-15), differs only in
its mythological coloring from the representations in the Bible
of dreams in which God comes or appears to the sleeper, or in
which he charges an angel to convey to him his purpose or his
will. And the discrimination commanded to be exercised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110"> 110</span>
between prophecies or dreams deserving attention, and prophecies
or dreams contrived merely to test the fidelity of the
Israelites, and therefore not to be received as true, fully corresponds
to the distinction drawn in the Odyssey between dreams
passing through the iron gate, and dreams passing through the
ivory gate. Those that came through the horn gate brought
true intimations; but those that came through the ivory gate
were sent to deceive (Od. xix. 560-568).</p>

<p>Another involuntary action through which God communicates
with man is sneezing. From the lowest savages to the
most educated nation on the face of the earth, this simple physical
event is viewed as an omen. A peculiarity attending this
particular kind of manifestation is, that it is usual for those
present when it occurs to notice it by saying something of favorable
augury. In Samoa, one of the Polynesian islands, it was
common to say, "Life to you!" (N. Y., p. 347.) an exclamation
which in sense corresponds almost exactly to the German
"Gesundheit!" (health) to the Italian "Salute!" and to our
own "God bless you!" on the same occasion. South African
savages have the same sentiment of the religious nature of the
omen involved in sneezing. Thus, among the Kafirs we learn
that "it used always to be said when a man sneezed, 'May
Utikxo [God] ever regard me with favor.'" Canon Callaway,
who has acutely noticed the parallelism among various nations
in respect of the feeling associated with this action, further
informs us that "among the Amazulu, if a child sneeze, it is
regarded as a good sign; and if it be ill, they believe it will
recover. On such an occasion they exclaim, 'Tutuka,' Grow.
When a grown up person sneezes, he says, 'Bakiti, ngi hambe
kade,' Spirits of our people, grant me a long life. As he believes
that at the time of sneezing the spirit of his house is in some
especial proximity to him, he believes it is a time especially
favorable to prayer, and that whatever he asks for will be given;
hence he may say, 'Bakwiti, inkomo,' Spirits of our people,
give me cattle, or 'Bakwiti, abntwana,' Spirits of our people,
give me children. Diviners among the natives are very apt to
sneeze, which they regard as an indication of the presence of
the spirits; the diviner adores by saying, 'Makosi,' Lords, or
Masters" (R. S. A., part i. p. 64). A similar belief prevails among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111"> 111</span>
the Parsees, who consider a sneeze as a mark of victory
obtained over the evil spirits who besiege the interior of the
body by the fire which animates man, and who accordingly render
thanks to Ahuramazda when this event happens (Z. A., vol.
ii. p. 598).</p>

<p>Classical antiquity presents us with an example of a famous
sneeze. At a critical moment in the expedition of the Ten
Thousand against Artaxerxes, when they were left in a hostile
country surrounded with perplexities and perils, Xenophon
encouraged them by an address in which he urged that if they
would take a certain course, they had with the favor of the gods,
many and good hopes of safety. Just at these words, "somebody
sneezes," and immediately the drooping hearts of the soldiery
were comforted by this assurance of divine protection.
With one impulse they worshipped the god; and Xenophon
remarked that since, when they were in the very act of speaking
of safety, this favorable augury of Zeus the Savior had
appeared, it seemed proper to him that they should vow thank-offerings
to this deity, to be presented on their first arrival in a
friendly country, and also that they should make a vow to sacrifice
to the other gods according to their ability (Xen. Anab. iii.
2. 9). Not only is it customary in Germany to welcome a sneeze
with the above-mentioned exclamation of "Gesundheit!" but
a notion is stated to prevail that should one person be thinking
of something in the future, and another sneeze at the moment he
is thus engaged, the thing thought of will come to pass. So that
the commonest character ascribed to sneezing is that of an auspicious
omen.</p>

<p>Other phenomena may serve as omens, and such phenomena
may be either natural or preternatural. In the first case their
prophetic or significant character is entirely due to the interpretation
put upon them by men; in the second, it is inherent
in their very nature, which at once renders them conspicuous
as exceptions to the usual course. Those of the first class have
thus a dual function; contemplated on the other side, they are
merely events belonging to the regular sequence of causes and
effects; contemplated on the other, they are especially contrived
as indications of the divine purposes. Hence, to one observer
they may bear the appearance of ordinary phenomena; to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112"> 112</span>other,
better informed, they may convey important intimations
of the future. Tacitus mentions, for example, the favorable
augury that was granted to the Romans on the eve of a battle
with the Germans by the flight of eight eagles who sought the
woods (Tac. Ann., ii. 17. 2). The same author informs us of a
melancholy omen which occurred to Paetus when he and his
army were crossing the Euphrates. Without apparent cause, the
horse which bore the consular insignia turned backwards (Ibid.,
xv. 7. 3). Each of these signs was of course followed by its
appropriate events. A belief which is thus found in a civilized
nation naturally has its prototype among the uncivilized. The
Kafirs believe that the spirits send them omens. Thus a wild
animal entering a kraal is "regarded as a messenger from the
spirit to remind the people that they have done something
wrong." Another omen which is considered very terrible is the
bleating of a sheep while it is being slaughtered. A councilor,
to whom it occurred to hear this sign, was told by a prophet
that it "foreboded his death." Strange to say, his chief soon
after sent soldiers to kill him, and the man only averted his
threatened fate by escaping to Natal. Among other natural
events which are omens to the Kafirs are, "a child born dead;
a woman two days in parturition; a man burnt while sitting by
the fire, unless he were asleep or drunk" (K. N. pp. 162, 163).
"An unexpected whirlwind will suggest to" the Chinese "the
contest of evil spirits; and the flying of a crow in a peculiar
direction fill them with consternation. In such a deplorable
state," gravely observes the missionary who records these facts,
"is the heathen mind" (C. O., vol. ii. p. 208). Perhaps he did
not consider that there were many in more enlightened countries
who would be alarmed at the omen implied by a dinner-party
of thirteen, and who would regard it as of evil augury to
begin a journey on Friday. In such a deplorable state is the
Christian mind.</p>

<p>Ceylon appears to be remarkable for the faith placed by its inhabitants
in omens, which are even said to regulate their whole
conduct and to intimate their destiny from birth onwards.
Children, of whose future the astrologers predict evil, are sometimes
destroyed in order to avoid their pre-determined misery.
On going out in the morning, the Singhalese anxiously remark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113"> 113</span>
the object they encounter first, in order to deduce from it a
favorable or unfavorable augury for the business of the day.
"I, as a European," says the author who tells us these facts,
"was always a glad sight to them;" for "a white man or a
woman with child" were good omens; but beggars and deformed
persons so unlucky, as even to stop these hapless folk from proceeding
in the work they were about during the day on which
these boding signs were the first things to meet their gaze (A.
I. C., p. 194). Another phenomenon of a somewhat less ordinary
kind serves as an omen to the Singhalese, though apparently
only in reference to a single fact. There is visible in Ceylon
"a peculiar and beautiful meteor," termed "Buddha rays,"
which "is supposed by the natives only to appear over a temple
or tomb of Buddha's relics, and from thence to emanate."
The appearance of these rays is taken by believers as a sign
that the Buddhist faith will last for the destined span of five
thousand years from its founder's death (E. Y., vol. i. p. 337);
much as the rainbow is held by Jews and Christians to be the
token of a promise that God will never again punish the world
by a universal deluge.</p>

<p>The next class of omens need not consist of phenomena
which are absolutely beyond the range of physical law, provided
they be sufficiently rare to strike the imagination of observers
as marvelous occurrences. For example, an eclipse of
the sun may be an omen to savage or very uninstructed people;
a comet, being more unusual, will seem ominous to nations
standing on a much higher grade of culture. Advancing still
higher, extraordinary and inexplicable sights in the heavens or
on earth will stand for portents to all but the scientifically
minded. An example of the latter class is found in the temporary
withering of the Ruminal tree, which had sheltered the
infancy of Romulus and Remus 840 years before (Tac. Ann.,
xiii. 58). At the time at which Tacitus begins his history, there
were, he says, prodigies in the sky and on earth, warnings of
lightnings and presages of future things (Tac. Hist., i. 3. 2).
Popular imagination, besides converting natural, but rare, phenomena
into omens, invents others which are altogether supernatural.
In the disturbed days of Otho and Vitellius, it was
rumored that a form of larger than human dimensions had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114"> 114</span>
issued from the shrine of Juno; that a statue of Julius on the
Tiberine island had turned round from west to east without any
perceptible agency; that an ox in Etruria had spoken; that
animals had brought forth strange progeny; and that other
alarming exceptions to the laws of nature had been observed
(Ibid., i. 86. 1). The supposed contraction of a man's shadow is
thought in South Africa to portend his death (R. S. A., pt. i. p.
126). The Irish Banshee is a being who does not belong to any
species recognized by science, and who, moreover, is heard to
scream only before a death in the family to which she is attached.
The ticking sound produced by a small insect in the
wooden furniture of a room is termed in Scotland the death-watch,
and has the same ominous significance. To one family,
a drummer heard to drum outside the castle is significant of
death; in another, it may be that a particular ghost, seen by a
casual visitor who knows nothing of its meaning, conveys a
similar intimation. The birth of great men is often supposed
to be marked by extraordinary signs. "At my nativity," says
Owen Glendower,</p>

<p>From signs which the bounty of nature supplies without
effort on the part of human beings, we proceed to those which
are granted only in reply to solicitations on the part of some
person or persons in quest of supernatural information. Of
these, a leading place must be assigned to those which are
obtained through the medium of diviners. Divination is in
many parts of the world a highly-developed and lucrative art.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115"> 115</span>
The natives of South Africa, being in any perplexity, resort to
the professional diviner to help them out of it. Should cattle
be lost, should a goat be too long in giving birth to its kids,
should a relation be ill, the diviner is asked to inform those
who consult him, both what it is that has happened, and what
they are to do. Sometimes his replies are assisted by sticks
held by the people, who beat them vehemently on the ground
when he divines correctly, and gently when he divines incorrectly;
sometimes he himself makes use of small sticks or
bones, which indicate by their movements the thing desired to
be known; sometimes again mysterious voices, supposed to be
those of spirits, are heard to speak. In a case related by one
of Canon Callaway's informants (who was quite sceptical as to
that class of diviners who required the people to strike the
ground), a correct answer was given by a diviner who employed
bones as his professional instruments. He had gone to inquire
about a goat of his brother's, which had been yeaning some
days, and had not brought forth. The diviner discovered from
his bones what was the matter; he declared that the she-goat
had been made ill by sorcerers, and told them that when they
reached home it would have given birth to two kids. The prediction
was fulfilled. On reaching home there were two kids, a
white and a grey one; the very colors the diviner had seen in
his inspired vision. "I was at once satisfied," observes the
narrator (R. S. A., pt. iii. p. 334-336). Another mode of divining
is by the aid of "familiar spirits," who address the consulting
party without being themselves visible. A native relates that
his adopted father went to inquire of a diviner by spirits (named
Umancele) concerning his wife's illness. When the relations of
the sick woman entered to salute, some heard the spirits saluting
them, saying, "Good-day, So and So." The person thus
addressed started, and exclaimed, "Oh, whence does the voice
come? I was saluting Umancele yonder." The divination in
this case was not successful, and the narrator pathetically
regrets that a bullock was given to the diviner for his false
information. In another case a woman, who likewise divined
by means of spirits, was perfectly correct in all she said. Some
members of a family in which a little boy suffered from convulsions
went to consult her; and she discovered, or rather the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116"> 116</span>
spirits discovered for her, what was the matter with him; what
was the relationship of those who had come; and what were
their circumstances. She prescribed a remedy, and predicted a
complete recovery. The cause of the illness was, according to
her, the displeasure of ancestral spirits. A sacrifice was to be
offered to them; and the village was to be removed to another
place. These things done, she declared that the boy would have
no more of the convulsions from which he suffered. If he did,
they might take back their money. All turned out as she had
said, to the very letter (R. S. A., pt. iii. p. 361-374).</p>

<p>The priests of the North American tribes have a peculiar
method of divination. Having received a handful of tobacco as
a fee, they will summon a spirit to answer the inquiries of their
visitors. This they do by enclosing themselves in lodges, in
which they utter incantations. As may be supposed, the spirits
who obey the summons of the Indian priest are not much more
useful as guides to action than those who figure at the seance
of his civilized competitor, the medium. Their replies, "though
usually clear and correct, are usually of that profoundly ambiguous
purport which leaves the anxious inquirer little wiser than
he was before" (M. N. W., p. 268). Brinton, however, having
stated this, proceeds to speak of cases, apparently well attested,
in which the diviners have foreseen coming events with unaccountable
clearness. For instance, when Captain Jonathan
Carver, in 1767, was among the Killistenoes, and that tribe was
suffering from want of food, the chief priest consulted the
divinities, and predicted with perfect accuracy the hour on the
following day when a canoe would arrive. Brinton adds, on
the authority of John Mason Brown, that when Mr. Brown and
two companions were pursuing an "apparently hopeless quest"
for a band of Indians, they were met by some warriors of that
very band, who declared that the appearance of the white man
had been exactly described by the medicine-man who had sent
them. And what renders the story remarkable is, that "the
description was repeated to Mr. Brown by the warriors before
they saw his two companions." The priest was unable to explain
what he had done, except by saying that "he saw them
coming, and heard them talk on their journey" (M. N. W., pp.
270, 271).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117"> 117</span></p>

<p>Among the Ostiacks in former days, the priests, when they
intended to divine, caused themselves to be bound, threw themselves
on the ground, and made all sorts of grimaces and contortions
till they felt themselves inspired with a reply to the
question that had been put to the idol. Those who had come
to consult the oracle, sighed and moaned and struck upon certain
vessels so as to make a noise, till they saw a bluish vapor,
which they conceived to be the spirit of prophecy, and which,
while spreading over all the spectators, seized the diviner and
caused him to fall into convulsions (Bernard, vol. viii. p. 412).</p>

<p>In ancient China, "the instruments of divination were the
shell of the tortoise and the stalks of a certain grass or reed"
(C. C., vol. iii. Proleg. p. 196). These are frequently spoken of
in the sacred books as the "tortoise and milfoil," and there
are historical examples of their employment. The following
rules for divination are given by a speaker in the Shoo King:—</p>

<p>"Having chosen and appointed officers for divining by the
tortoise and by the milfoil, they are to be charged <i>on occasion</i>
to perform their duties. <i>In doing this</i>, they will find <i>the appearances</i>
of rain, clearing up, cloudiness, want of connection, and
crossing; and <i>the symbols</i>, solidity and repentance. In all, <i>the
indications</i> are seven;—five given by the tortoise, and two by
the milfoil, by which the errors of <i>affairs</i> may be traced out.
These officers having been appointed, when the operations with
the tortoise and milfoil are proceeded with, three men are to
obtain and interpret the indications and symbols, and the consenting
words of two of them are to be followed" (C. C., vol.
iii. p. 335).</p>

<p>Further instructions are then given in case the Emperor,
nobles, officers, or people, and any or all of these, should disagree
with the tortoise and milfoil; the greater weight being
given to the latter (Ibid., p. 327).</p>

<p>Of modern divination in China, Dr. Legge recounts the following
story:—</p>

<p>"I once saw a father and son divining after one of the fashions
of the present day. They tossed the bamboo roots, which
came down in the unlucky positions for a dozen times in succession.
At last a lucky cast was made. They looked into each
other's faces, laughed heartily, and rose up, delighted, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118"> 118</span>
their knees. The divination was now successful, and they dared
not repeat it!" (Ibid., Proleg. p. 197).</p>

<p>Here it seems that heaven was merely called in to give its
sanction to a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>The Singhalese have a curious method of discovering, by a
species of divination, what god it is who has caused the illness
of a patient. "With any little stick," says Knox, "they make
a bow, and on the string thereof they hang a thing they have
to cut betel-nuts, somewhat like a pair of scissors; then holding
the stick or bow by both ends, they repeat the names of
all, both god and devils: and when they come to him who hath
afflicted them, then the iron or the bowstring will swing" (H.
R. C., p. 76).</p>

<p>Divination, as is well known, was regularly practiced by the
ancients, who read the will of the gods in the entrails of animals,
and who employed, as a help in foreseeing the future and
guiding their conduct, the class of professional diviners known
as augurs.</p>

<p>Another method, by which it has often been supposed that
God entered into communication with man, is that of the movements
of the stars and planets. Hence the pseudo-science of
astrology, which was so much cultivated in the middle ages
before its supersession by astronomy. In India, observes Karl
Twesten, the stars were very early consulted as oracles. Manu
excludes astrologers from the sacrifices; and in later times
astrology became very general. According to Twesten, there is
an astrologer in almost every Hindu community, who is much
consulted, and determines the favorable moment for every important
undertaking (R. I., p. 285). Antiquity, wide extension,
and great persistency may all be pleaded on behalf of the notion
that terrestrial events are foreshadowed by a system of celestial
signals. There is a touch of astrological belief in the evangelical
narrative that the birth of Christ was intimated to the
Magi by a star in the east.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when it was desirable not to ascertain future
events, but to decide between guilt and innocence, truth and
falsehood, the divine Being himself was called in as umpire,
and was supposed to convey his judgment by the turn of events
in a pre-arranged case. This is the theory of those communi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119"> 119</span>cations
from God to man which are made by ordeals. Ordeals
were of various kinds, according to the nature of the issue to
be tried. Did one man charge another with some kind of disgraceful
conduct, the accuser was summoned to put his words
to the test of a single combat, in which truth was held to lie
on the side of the victor; was an old woman suspected of witchcraft,
she was thrown into the nearest pond, with thumbs and
toes tied together, where her floating was regarded as certain
evidence of her guilt. Innocence of legal crime, or in the case
of women, of adultery, has very frequently been established by
the method of ordeals. Several authors have noticed the ordeals
in use among the natives on the west coast of Africa.
One of them, writing of Sierra Leone, informs us that if an
accused person can find a chief to patronize him, he is permitted
to clear himself by submitting either to have a hot iron
applied to his skin, or to dip his hand in boiling oil to pull out
some object put into it, or to have his tongue stroked with a
red-hot copper ring. Since his being burnt is considered as a
proof of guilt, it would not appear that the chances of escape
were great. "Upon the Gold Coast, the ordeal consists in
chewing the bark of a tree, with a prayer that it may cause
his death if he be not innocent." In the neighborhood of Sierra
Leone, a very peculiar ordeal is practiced, that, namely, of
drinking water prepared from the bark of a certain tree, and
termed "red water." Before taking it, the drinker repeats a
prayer containing an imprecation on himself if guilty. Should
this decoction cause purging or pains in the bowels, it is a
proof of guilt; should it, on the contrary, excite vomiting, and
produce no effect on the bowels for twenty-four hours, an acquittal
ensues, and the person who has thus successfully undergone
the trial is held in higher esteem than he enjoyed before
(N. A., vol. i. p. 129-133). Sometimes this singular mode of trial
is employed in cases where a corpse is supposed to have accused
some person of causing the death of its former owner (S. L., p.
124-127). On the Gold Coast, "every person entering into any
obligation is obliged to drink the swearing liquor." Thus,
should one nation intend to assist another, "all the chief ones
are obliged to drink this liquor, with an imprecation that their
<i>fetiche</i> may punish them with death if they do not assist them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120"> 120</span>
with utmost vigor to extirpate their enemy." Since, however,
a dispensing power over such oaths has been exercised by the
priests, some negroes observe the precaution, before taking
oaths, of causing the priest to swear first, and then drink the
red water, with an imprecation that the fetich may punish him
if he absolves any one without the consent of all the parties
interested in the contract (D. C. G., pp. 124, 125).</p>

<p>The sanction of Scripture is given to an ordeal of precisely
this nature is the case of women charged with adultery; and it
is curious to find the very same mode of testing the fidelity of
wives employed both by the ancient Hebrews and modern
negroes. The law of Moses was, that if a man suspected his
wife of unfaithfulness, and the "spirit of jealousy" came upon
him, he might take her to the priest (with an offering, of
course), and leave him to deal with her in the following manner:
Taking holy water in an earthen vessel, the priest was to mix
in it some of the dust of the floor of the tabernacle, and set the
woman with her head uncovered, and the jealousy offering in
her hands, "before the Lord." He was then to "charge her with
an oath," saying, that if she was pure, she was to be free from
the bitter water that caused the curse, but if not, the Lord was
to make her a curse and an oath among her people, causing
her hips (or thighs) to disappear and her belly to swell. The
water was to go into her bowels to produce these effects.
Hereupon the woman was to say, "Amen, amen." According to
the effects of the bitter water upon her constitution, was her
guilt or her innocence adjudged to be (Num. v. 11-31).</p>

<p>Now the procedure of the negroes, in similar cases, is almost
an exact reproduction (it can scarcely be an imitation) of that
enjoined by Jehovah. "Red water" is administered, instead of
"bitter water;" but with this exception, precisely the same
method is pursued, and precisely the same doctrine underlies
the use of the ordeal. God is expected, both by Jews and
negroes, to manifest the truth where human skill is incompetent
to discover it. The negroes, according to Bosman, believe
that where the red water is drunk by one who makes a false
declaration, he will either "be swelled by that liquor till he
bursts," or will "shortly die of a languishing sickness; the
first punishment they imagine more peculiar to women, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121"> 121</span>
take this draught to acquit them of any accusation of adultery:"
a belief which curiously reminds us of the old Jewish superstition,
that the hips will fall away and the belly swell in the case
of the adulterous wife who has taken the bitter water on a
false pretence. Bosman himself has correctly observed on the
remarkable similarity of the two procedures (D. C. G., p. 125).</p>

<p>A slightly different mode of trying suspected adultresses by
ordeal prevails among the Ostiacks (in Northern Asia). Should
an Ostiack entertain doubts of his wife's fidelity, he cuts off a
handful of hair from a bear's skin, and takes it to her. If
innocent, she receives it without hesitation; but if guilty, she
does not venture to touch it, and is accordingly repudiated.
The conviction reigns among these people, that were a woman
to lie under these circumstances, the bear to whom the hair
belonged would revive in three days and come to devour her
(Bernard, vol. viii. pp. 44, 45).</p>

<p>More important, however, and more universal than any of
the above means of communication from God to man, is the
method of communication by miracles. There is probably no
great religion in the world, the establishment of which has
been altogether dissociated from miracles. They form the most
striking, most indisputable, most intelligible proof of the divine
will. Not indeed that there is any close logical connection
between the performance of a wonder, and the truth of the
wonder-worker's doctrines; but popular imagination jumps
readily to the conclusion that a man, whom rumor or tradition
has invested with supernatural powers over nature, must also
be in possession of correct opinions, or even of superhuman
knowledge, on the mysterious questions with which religion
deals. Hence ecclesiastical historians, of all ages and countries,
have sought to show that those from whom they deduced the
systems in which they wished their readers to believe, were
either themselves gifted with thaumaturgic faculties, or were
the subjects of special marvels worked upon them. Such miracles
have always served as their credentials, indicating their
high character, and entitling them to demand the obedience of
mankind to the commands they brought.</p>

<p>The establishment of Buddhism, for example, was attended
by the performance of extraordinary miracles. Not only did the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122"> 122</span>
Buddha himself frequently perform supernatural feats; not only
did his disciples, when they attained a certain grade of sanctity,
receive the faculty of flying and doing other wonderful
things; but he actually proved the superiority of his claims over
those of others by a pitched battle in thaumaturgy. Certain
Tirthyas, or heretical teachers, had the audacity to challenge
him to contend with them in working miracles, and the trial of
skill ended, of course, in their ignominious defeat (H. B. I., p.
162-189). Much in the same way did Moses enter into a rivalry
with Pharaoh's magicians, who were overcome by his superior
miracles as the Tirthyas were by those of Gautama Buddha.
As Jewish prophets and Christian saints received by spiritual
inheritance the power of performing miracles, so also did the
Fathers of Buddhism. Of one of the greatest of these, named
Nagardjuna, it is related that a Brahman who had entered into
a dispute with him produced a magical pond, in the middle of
which was a lotus with a thousand leaves, but that Nagardjuna
produced a magical elephant which destroyed the magical pond
(Wassiljew, p. 231). This again may remind us of the serpent of
Moses, which swallowed up the serpents of the magicians; or of
the fire brought down from heaven by Elijah in his controversy
with the prophets of Baal. Another eminent Buddhist, Asvagosha,
was remarkable as a preacher. The officials at the court
of a certain king reproached him with holding this holy man
in too high esteem. The king thereupon took seven horses,
kept them six days without food, and then led them to the
place where Asvagosha was preaching to be fed. The horses
would not touch the food that was offered, but shed tears at the
words of the preacher (Wassiljew, p. 232).</p>

<p>The history of the Mongols records some equally wonderful
performances on the part of a Lama (or priest) named Bogda.
When some messengers came to meet him, he raised his hand
in a threatening way against a river, the waters of which
immediately began to run upwards instead of downwards;
"by which miracle," observes the historian, "an unshakeable
faith was established in all minds." No wonder. The division
of the Red Sea and the Jordan were child's play to this. The
same man caused many others to believe by suddenly producing
a spring in a dry place. In another country which he vis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123"> 123</span>ited,
he subdued all the dragons and other baneful creatures to
his will (G. O. M., p. 227).</p>

<p>If the founder of the Mussulman religion did not claim any
direct power of performing miracles, yet the communication to
him of the Suras which compose the Koran was a standing
miracle. He professed to fall into an ecstatic condition, in
which he received the direct instructions of his God; and his
care, when entering the sick-room of a friend, to avoid treading
on the angels' wings which he saw extended in all directions,
indicates a pretension to more than human faculties. The
present votaries of the Mohammedan faith believe in the power
of their saints to work miracles, for we read of the sick being
taken to their Sheik to be cured by the imposition of his feet
(Dervishes, p. 347).</p>

<p>That the Christian religion was largely indebted to miracles
for its success during its early years need hardly be remarked.
Not only did Christ himself perform miracles of the most extraordinary
kind, but the power was, if not wholly, yet to some
extent, transmitted to his apostles, and was frequently exercised
by the saints and Fathers of the early Church. Jesus
himself, according to tradition, relied largely on his miracles as
proofs of his divine mission; for when John the Baptist sent
disciples to inquire who he was, he replied by telling them to
report to their master that the blind received sight, the lame
walked, the lepers were cleansed, the deaf heard, the dead were
raised up, and the poor had the gospel preached to them. So
that the possession of this unusual gift of healing and re-animating,
was regarded by him (or, more accurately, by his biographers)
as a sufficient answer to the doubt entertained by John
whether he were really the Messiah, or whether another were
to come.</p>

<p>How great was the importance attached to the possession of
miraculous powers by the early Christian Church, may be gathered
from a passage in which Irenæus endeavors to cover certain
heretics with confusion, by asserting that they are unable
to do the things that are commonly done by the adherents
of the true faith. "For they can neither confer sight on the
blind, nor hearing on the deaf, nor chase away all sorts of
demons—[none, indeed], except those that are sent into others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124"> 124</span>
by themselves, if they can even do so much as this. Nor can
they cure the weak, or the lame, or the paralytic, or those who
are distressed in any other part of the body, as has often been
done in regard to bodily infirmity. Nor can they furnish effective
remedies for those external accidents which may occur.
And so far are they from being able to raise the dead, as the
Lord raised them, and the apostles did by means of prayer, and
as has been frequently done in the brotherhood on account of
some necessity—the entire Church in that particular locality
entreating [the boon] with much fasting and prayer, the spirit
of the dead man has returned, and he has been bestowed in
answer to the prayers of the saints—that they do not even
believe this can possibly be done, [and hold] that the resurrection
from the dead is simply an acquaintance with that truth
which they proclaim."<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus, the cure of infirmities and diseases
by supernatural means were every-day achievements of
the early Christians; and even the dead were sometimes restored
to life, when sufficient pains were taken to obtain the favorable
attention of the Almighty. "It is not possible," observes the
same author in another place, "to name the number of the
gifts which the Church [scattered] throughout the whole world
has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ, who was
crucified under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day
for the benefit of the Gentiles."<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Hence the Mormons, who claim to possess at the present day
the powers which have departed from Christians in general, are
perfectly in accordance with Irenæus in holding that signs like
these are invariably attendant on the kingdom of God. Revelations,
visions, the powers of prophecy, of healing, of speaking
with tongues, of casting out devils, and working other miracles,
are (they contend) the prerogatives of those who belong to this
kingdom. History, in relating first the miracles of the Jewish
patriarchs and prophets, then those of the Christian Fathers,
powerfully supports this theory. Scripture in several unambiguous
passages entirely confirms it. And the daily experience of
the Latter-day Saints, if we accept their statements, bears witness
to its truth, by presenting abundant examples of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125"> 125</span>
actual exercise of such supernatural gifts within their own
society. Thus, one person is cured of blindness; another of
dislocation of the thigh; another has his fractured backbone
restored; in the fourth case it is a rupture that is healed; in
the fifth convulsive fits that are stopped.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I have myself been
present at a Mormon meeting for public worship, and have
heard the saints who were gathered together narrate, with perfect
solemnity and apparent good faith, the miraculous cures
which they themselves experienced, or which they had personally
witnessed. One after another rose to bear his testimony
to some case of the kind which had fallen within his immediate
knowledge. To these uncultivated and fanatical people,
holy events still were what they have long ceased to be to the
ordinary Christian world—living realities; and we may still
study in them the mental condition of those who could accept
as phenomena occurring in their own day the restoration of
sight, hearing, or speech; the expulsion of devils; and the resurrection
of the dead.</p>

<small>HOLY PLACES.</small></h3></div>


<p>"Draw not nigh hither," said the occupant of the burning
bush to Moses; "put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the
place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exod. iii. 5).
This verse embodies the universal theory of holy places. They
are spots occupied in a special and peculiar manner by the
deity or his representative; and where he finds it easier to
communicate with mankind than it is elsewhere. Hence, those
who hope or desire to receive some celestial intimation, resort
to such holy places. The oracles of the ancient world, and the
temple at Jerusalem, are instances of holy places where the
respective gods worshiped by those who frequented them gave
responses, or manifested their presence. Holy places are not
always consecrated places. Sometimes—as in the case of the
Delphian oracle—the consecration is the work of nature; the
divinity intimates in some unmistakable way his presence in
the sanctuary which he has himself selected; and human beings
have nothing to do but humbly to receive such communications
as he may desire to make. Frequently, however, holy
places have only become holy by the act of consecration; the
local god has not occupied them until they have been duly prepared
for him by human labor. On the other hand, consecrated
places are always holy places. Not indeed that there are always
conspicuous intimations of the divine presence; but it is nevertheless
vaguely supposed to haunt the buildings where worship
is offered, and rites are performed, more than it does the outer
world.</p>

<p>To begin with a few instances of holy places which have not
undergone consecration. On the coast of Guinea "almost every
village hath a small appropriated grove." Offerings are made in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127"> 127</span>
these groves, and they are regarded as so sacred that no one ventures
to injure the trees by plucking, cutting, or breaking their
branches. "Universal malediction" would be one of the consequences
of such misconduct (D. C. G., p. 128). Mr. Turner
states that "as of old in Canaan, sacred <i>groves</i> for heathen
worship, with and without temples, were quite common in the
islands of the Pacific" (N. Y., p. 329). These are instances of
the sacredness so frequently attached to woods and forests by
primitive nations.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">"The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Natural characteristics in the same manner determine the
quality of holiness attributed to certain spots by the natives of
Africa. Holy places among them are those where a god dwells
either visibly or invisibly; particular buildings, huts, or hills;
or trees which are remarkable for age, size, and strength. They
have also sacred groves into which no negro, not being a priest
ventures to intrude. One of the tribes asserts that their god has
his dwelling-place in the cavern of a rock that is situated in
the bushes (G. d. M., p. 326).</p>

<p>A singular example of a holy place in a more advanced religion
is the neighborhood of the Bo tree, or Bogaha tree, in Ceylon,
under whose shade the people worship at the great festival.
This tree derives its sanctity from the circumstance of its
having sheltered Buddha at an eventful crisis of his life. Near
it ninety kings are interred; huts are erected around it for the
use of the devotees who repair to it; and as "every sort of
uncleanness and dust must be removed from the sacred spot,"
the approaches are continually swept by persons appointed for
the purpose. Besides the Bo tree, and the pagodas—or public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128"> 128</span>
temples—many of the Singhalese have private holy places in
their own houses. They "build in their yards <i>private</i> chapels,
which are little houses like to closets," and in these they place
an image of the Buddha which they worship (H. R. C., p. 73).</p>

<p>Graves of the dead whom we have loved are apt to become
holy places to us all; and in some religious creeds, such as
those of Islam and Christianity, this veneration is extended to
the tombs of persons who have been distinguished by their
sanctity. Mussulmans "pray at the tomb of those they repute
saints;" and expect by offering vows at such places, to obtain
"relief, through their saintly intercession, from sickness, misfortune.
sterility, &amp;c." Miracles take place at these tombs, and
supernatural lights float over them (Dervishes, pp. 79, 80). It is
believed, too, that "the merits of the deceased will insure a
favorable reception of the prayers which they offer up in such
consecrated places" (Dervishes, p. 272).</p>

<p>Sometimes, again, the place where some striking event in the
history of religion has occurred, acquires a holiness of its own.
Thus the Scala Santa at Rome enjoys a preëminent holiness
possessing the merit of procuring a considerable remission of
punishment for those who perform the task of ascending it on
their knees.</p>

<p>The oracle of Clarius Apollo at Colophon, mentioned by Tacitus,
is an example of a large and important class of holy
places which were not consecrated places. Here it was not a
woman, as at Delphi (observes Tacitus), who gave the responses;
but a priest, who descended into a cavern, and drank water
from a secret fountain (Tac. Ann., ii. 54). In Jewish history we
meet with a remarkable instance of a place originally hallowed
by the actual appearance of God, in the case of Bethel, "the
house of God," where Jacob was favored with his remarkable
dream. "How dreadful is this place!" exclaimed the patriarch
on waking; "this is none other but the house of God, and this
is the gate of heaven" (Gen. xxviii. 17). In the spot whose
holiness had thus been rendered manifest, Jacob proceeded to
perform consecrating rites; but, contrary to the usual order,
the holiness preceded and induced the consecration.</p>

<p>More generally, consecration forms a sort of invitation to
the deity to inhabit the place which has thus been rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129"> 129</span>
suited to his abode. Of the holy places which are also consecrated,
a conspicuous place is due to Solomon's temple; in the
dedication of which the theory just stated is clearly embodied.
Solomon, or his historians, perceived the difficulty of causing a
being so transcendently powerful as Jehovah to dwell within
local limits. The monarch, in his consecrating prayer, explains
that he is well aware that even the heaven of heavens cannot
contain him; much less this house that he has built. Nevertheless,
he cannot give up the notion that this house may, in some
degree, be peculiarly favored by having his especial attention
directed towards it. His eyes at least may be open towards it,
and if he cannot be there himself, his name may. Moreover,
when prayers are offered in the temple, he may listen to them
more graciously than to other supplications; and when the
asseverations of contending parties are confirmed by oaths
taken before the altar it contains, he may take unusual pains
to execute justice between them. Jehovah fully approves of his
servant's proposals. He emphatically declares in reply that he
has hallowed this house which he has built, to put his name
there for ever; and that his eyes and his heart shall be there
perpetually (Kings viii. 22-ix. 3).</p>

<p>Very primitive peoples hold similar views of the relation of
their deities to their temples. Just as there was "an oracle"
in the Jewish temple, where "the glory of the Lord filled the
house of the Lord, as it had filled the corresponding place in
the tabernacle, so in most of the Fijian temples there is a
shrine, where the god is supposed to descend when holding
communication with the priests; and there is also a long piece
of native cloth hung at one end of the building, and from the
very ceiling, which is also connected with the arrival and
departure of the god invoked" (Viti, p. 393). It seems to have
been a general rule in the temples of these islands to have
some object specially connected with the deity, and through
which he might manifest his presence in the place. Thus, in
one of them there was a conch shell, which "the god was supposed
to blow when he wished the people to rise to war" (N. Y.,
p. 240). Nay, there was even an altar erected to Jehovah and
Jesus Christ in one of the islands, "to which persons afflicted
with all manner of diseases were brought to be healed; and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130"> 130</span>
great was the reputation which this maræ obtained, that the
power of Jehovah and Jesus Christ became great in the estimation
of the people" (N. M. E., p. 28). Here an altar, erected of
course by a man not yet converted to Christianity, received a
blessing no less conspicuous than that granted in ancient times
to Solomon's temple.</p>

<p>The Mexicans and Peruvians entertained a precisely similar
belief to that which we have observed among the Fijians and
the Hebrews. Father Acosta describes the ruins of a very large
building in Peru which had been a place of worship, where
immense plunder had been carried off by the Christians. In
this temple there was a sure tradition that "the devil" had
spoken, and given responses in his oracle. The fact of the devil
speaking and answering in these false sanctuaries is, according to
the learned father, a very common thing in America; but the
father of lies has become silent since the sign of the cross has
been raised in those regions of his previous power (H. I., b. v.
ch. 12). Not only were the temples holy in Peru, but the whole
of the imperial city of Cozco, the residence of the Incas, enjoyed
an exceptional holiness. So much was this the case, that if two
natives of equal rank met one another on the road, the one
coming from Cozco, and the other going to it, the one coming
from it received respect and reverence from the one going to
it, which was enhanced to a higher degree if he were a native
of Cozco (C. R., b. iii. ch. 20). In approaching the great temple
at Cozco, there were certain limits where all who passed were
obliged to take off their shoes: the very same sign of regard for
holy places which Moses was commanded to observe at the burning
bush; which is practiced by Parsee priests when ministering
in their temples, and by Mussulmans in reference to their
mosques (Ibid., b. iii. ch. 23).</p>

<p>Prohibition to all but holy persons to enter holy places is
not uncommon. The holy of holies in the Jewish temple might
be entered by no one but the high priest, and the utmost horror
was felt by the Jews at the violation of their sanctuary by
Pompey. A European traveler in Africa, finding a grove with
a mat hung before it, wished to enter; but was entreated not
to do so by the negroes, who informed him that a great spirit,
who might kill him if displeased, dwelt within. He, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131"> 131</span>
went in, and found a delightful place; this being one of those
to which only priests were admitted (G. d. M., p. 326). Similarly
among the Parsees, the Atesch-gâh, or holy place where worship
is performed, may be entered only by the priests, except
under special circumstances, when laymen may enter it after
due observance of preparatory rites, and with the face covered.
Such a case would occur if there were no priest to keep up the
sacred fire (Z. A., vol. ii. p. 569). In Mexico, where there were
two important holy places—the Cu, or great temple of Vitziliputzli,
and the temple of Tezcatlipuca—the priests alone had
the right of entry to this last (H. I., b. 5, ch. 13).</p>

<p>We thus find, among the several nations of the world, a consistent
and all-pervading theory of holy places. These are not
always the scenes of divine revelations, or of striking events
produced by the divine agency; but they are much more likely
to be so favored than other places, and if communications are
distinctly sought, it must generally be by resorting to such
local sanctuaries as are commonly reputed to be fitted for the
purpose. Where no revelation is either given or expected, the
holy place is yet the abiding home of the deity whose worship
is celebrated within its enclosure. And although Christians
may consider their God as present everywhere, yet they are
conscious on entering a church, of coming, in a peculiar sense,
into his presence; and they indicate that consciousness by
removing their hats, if men, and keeping the head covered, if
women. For such is the outward indication of respect which
the Christian God is supposed to require of those who set their
feet within his holy places.</p>

<small>HOLY OBJECTS.</small></h3></div>


<p>While a highly-exalted conception of the First cause of
nature would see him equally in everything, and believe the
whole world to be alike natural and divine, no actual religion,
believed by any considerable number of persons, has ever
reached so abstract an idea. To all of them some things are
more sacred than others; in the more primitive forms of faith
these things are either a species of divinities themselves, or
they are the abode of some divinity; in the more advanced
types, they are held to be sanctified by the power of God, or to
be the earthly representatives of his invisible majesty. To the
class of holy objects belong all charms, amulets, fetishes, sacred
animals, and other things of whatever kind, which are believed
in any country to possess a different order of powers from those
which scientific investigation discovers in them.</p>

<p>The theory underlying the use of such objects among the
negroes—and it is practically the same as that of more civilized
nations—is well explained by a German missionary. "Fetishes,
or Shambu," according to him, "are holy things, which
are supposed to have received a particular power from God,
both to drive away evil spirits, as also to be useful in all illnesses
and dangers, especially against sorcery." They cover both
themselves and their gods with fetishes. These descend from
father to son, and are preserved with the greatest care. Some
are kept in sanctuaries of their own. There exists among these
negroes (the Mavu) a class of professional fetish-makers, who
are mostly old women, and who wear a peculiar dress. A man,
who had fetishes at the bottom of his staircase, informed the
writer that their use was to keep the devil from getting into
his house. Another tribe of negroes prefer to take things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133"> 133</span>
have been struck by lightning for their fetishes: the lightning-stroke
being, as the missionary justly concludes, an indication
that a divine power has united itself to these objects (G. d. M.,
pp. 322, 323).</p>

<p>The natives of Sierra Leone are described as placing unlimited
faith in "griggories," or charms. These are made of goats'
skin; texts of the Koran are written upon them, and they are
worn upon various parts of the person. They have distinct
functions, each one being designed to preserve the wearer from
a certain kind of evil or danger (S. L., p. 132).</p>

<p>Numerous objects were holy in Peru. Rivers, fountains,
large stones, hills, the tops of mountains, are mentioned by
Acosta as having been adored by the Peruvians; indeed, he
says that they adored whatever natural object appeared very
different from the rest, recognizing therein some peculiar deity.</p>

<p>A certain tree, for instance, which was cut down by the
Spaniards, had long been an object of adoration to the Indians,
on account of its antiquity and size (H. I., b. 5, ch. 5). In another
part of the American continent, the neighborhood of
Acadia, a traveler tells us of a venerable tree which was likewise
holy. Many marvels were recounted of it, and it was
always loaded with offerings. The sea having washed the soil
from about its roots, it maintained itself a long time "almost
in the air," which confirmed the savages in their notion that
it was "the seat of some great spirit;" and even after it had
fallen, its branches, so long as they were visible above the surface
of the water, continued to receive the worship of the people
(N. F., vol. iii. p. 349).</p>

<p>Not unfrequently the holy object is an animal, and then it
may be regarded either as itself a god, or as sacred to some
god, who either makes it in some sense his abode, or regards
it with favor and takes it under his care. Among animals,
there is none more frequently worshiped than the serpent; and
it has been supposed, with some plausibility, that the Hebrew
legend of the fall was directed against serpent-worship. However
this may be, that worship is clearly discernible in the
story of the brazen serpent which healed the sickness of the
Israelites in the wilderness (Num. xxi. 8). This would seem to
be a dim tradition of a time at which the adoration of the ser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134"> 134</span>pent
was still practiced by the people of Jehovah. Many other
countries afford examples of the same worship. To take a
single case; the Chevalier des Marchais, who traveled in the
last century, relates that serpents of a certain kind were worshiped
in Guinea. There was one, however, which was called
the father of these gods, and was reputed to be of prodigious
size. It was kept in a place of its own, where it had "secret
apartments," and none but the chief sacrificer was permitted to
enter this holy of holies. The king himself might only see it
once, when, three months after his coronation, he went to present
his offerings (V. G., vol. ii. p. 169).</p>

<p>Even Christianity did not entirely put an end to the worship
of the serpent; for an early Christian writer, in a treatise
against all heresies, makes mention of a sect of Ophites
who (he says) "magnify the serpent to such a degree, that they
prefer him even to Christ himself; for it was he, they say, who
gave us the origin of the knowledge of good and evil. His
power and majesty (they say) Moses perceiving, set up the
brazen serpent; and whoever gazed upon him obtained health.
Christ himself (they say further) imitates Moses' serpent's
sacred power in saying: 'And as Moses upreared the serpent in
the desert, so it behoveth the Son of man to be upreared.'
Him they introduce to bless their eucharistic [elements]" (Adv.
omn. haereses., II.—A. N. L., vol. 18, p. 262).</p>

<p>Holy objects are very often connected with some eminent
man, from whose relation to them they derive their sanctity.
Such are all the innumerable relics of saints to which so much
importance is attached in Catholic countries. Such is that pre-eminently
sacred relic, the tooth of Buddha, so carefully preserved
and guarded in Ceylon. When Major Forbes witnessed
the tooth festival at Kandy, fifty-three years had passed since
the last exhibition of this deeply revered member of the founder
of the faith. It was kept in its temple within six cases; of
which the three larger ones having been first removed, the
three inner ones, containing it, were placed "on the back of an
elephant richly caparisoned." It was shown to the people on a
temporary altar, surrounded with rich hangings; the festival
being attended by crowds of pious worshipers, who thought
that the privilege of seeing the tooth, so rarely exhibited to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135"> 135</span>
public, was a sufficient proof of the merits they had obtained
in former lives (E. Y, vol. i. p. 290-293).</p>

<p>Mussulmans have their holy objects, consisting of verses of
the Koran, suspended or written on their dwellings, which are
supposed to insure their protection. Such verses, or short
Suras, are sometimes carried on the person engraved on stones
(Dervishes, p. 313).</p>

<p>Conspicuous among holy objects for the extraordinary virtues
ascribed to them, are the bread and wine of the Lord's supper.
These are believed by Christians either to be or to represent
(according to their several doctrines) the actual flesh and blood
of Jesus; and the mere fact of eating and drinking them, in
faith, is held to exercise a mystic efficacy over the life of the
communicant. A more singular instance of the holiness attributed
by an act of the imagination to material things can scarcely
be produced. Another curious case of the same notion is the
belief in holy water; which enjoys so great a power, that some
drops of it dashed upon an infant's forehead contribute to ensure
its eternal happiness; while it has also the gift of conferring
some kind of advantage upon the worshipers who, on
entering a church, sprinkle it upon their persons.</p>

<p>Images of the gods or saints worshiped in a country form a
large and important class of holy objects. Such were the "teraphim"
or "gods" stolen by Rachel from her father, and
which she concealed in the furniture of her camel (Gen. xxxi.
19, 30-35). Similar images are employed by the Tartars, who
place them at the heads and feet of their beds in certain fixed
positions, and who carry them about with them wherever they
go (Bergeron, Voyage de Rubruquis, ch. 3, p. 9).</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV_1">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>HOLY ORDERS.</small></h3></div>


<p>Rites, acts of worship and sacrifices, originally performed
by each individual at his own discretion, or by each household
in its own way, fall (as we have seen) with advancing
development into the hands of professional persons consecrated
for this especial purpose. Very great importance
attaches to these consecrated persons. The place they occupy
in all societies above the level of barbarism is one of peculiar
honor; and their influence on the course of human history has
in all ages with which that history is acquainted been conspicuous
and profound. Once devoted to their religious duties, they
become the authorized representatives of deity on earth. In
treating of their consecration, we consider them as channels of
communication from earth to heaven; we have now to consider
them as channels of communication from heaven to earth.</p>

<p>Endowed by the general wish of all human society with a
special right to convey their petitions to the divine beings
whom they worship, they do not fail to claim for themselves the
correlative right of conveying to men the commands, the intentions,
the reproofs, and the desires of these divine beings. It is
the priests alone who can pretend to know their minds. It is
the priests alone who can correctly interpret their often enigmatic
language. It is the priests alone through whom they
generally deign to converse with mortals.</p>

<p>Such is the ecclesiastical theory throughout the world; and
it is as a general rule accepted by the communities for whose
guidance it is constructed. Exceptions do indeed present themselves,
above all in the case of the remarkable men whose
careers we shall deal with in the ensuing chapter, who have
founded new religions independently of, or even in spite of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137"> 137</span>
very powerful existing priesthoods. And, speaking generally,
the holy class is not always coëxtensive with the consecrated
class. We shall notice further on an important order among
the Jews who were universally received as holy, without being
consecrated. Moreover, there has often existed a species of men
who, without regular consecration, have nevertheless served as
a channel of communication from God or from inferior spirits
to man. Such were magicians, astrologers, "et hoc genus
omne," in ancient times; such are the so-called mediums in
the present day. Conversely, consecration, though by its very
nature implying holiness as its correlative, implies it less and
less as we rise in the scale of culture. Thus, in the more
advanced forms of Protestantism, such as the Presbyterian or
the Unitarian, the minister is scarcely more than a mere
teacher; he has little or no more power to convey commands or
intimations from God than any member of his congregation.
So that we should have a rough approximation to the truth
were we to say that in the lower grades of religious culture we
have holy orders without consecration; while in the higher
grades we have consecrated orders without holiness.</p>

<p>Between these extremes there lies the great body of regular
and qualified priests, appointed to communicate upwards, and
entitled to communicate downwards. Invasions of their authority
by irregular pretenders are the exceptions, not the rule. It
is the usual order of things, that the decisions of priests on matters
pertaining to religion should be accepted in submissive
faith, by the societies to which they belong. Where, as in the
case of Jesus of Nazareth, some bold individual brushes aside
successfully the pretentions of ecclesiastical castes, the theory
is only modified to suit the individual instance. Ecclesiastical
castes, deriving their title from the innovator himself, spring
up again at once; and differ only in so far as the God whose
will they expound is either another God, or a new modification
of the same God.</p>

<p>Numerous privileges are generally accorded to priests.
Sometimes they enjoy exemptions from the operation of the
ordinary laws; sometimes they are permitted a disproportionate
share in the government of their country; sometimes, without
possessing recognized legislative powers, they control the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138"> 138</span>
destinies of nations by the expression of their views. Often, the
whole physical force of the government is at their disposal,
for the propagation and support of the system they uphold;
occasionally, when their authority has reached its highest point,
the mere solemn declaration of their commands is enough to
ensure the acquiescence of monarchs and the obedience of their
subjects. Corresponding to these considerable rights, they perform
a considerable variety of functions, which are regarded by
the societies who employ them as not only useful, but indispensable.
We find them in all primitive communities acting as
the recognized doctors of the people, treating their diseases by
the method of supernatural inspiration. Rising a little higher,
they predict that class of events which is so interesting to each
individual, namely, the prospects of his or her life. In other
words, they become fortune-tellers, astrologers, or (by whatever
means) readers of the future. Or they control the weather,
calling down from heaven the needful rain. They are inspired
by the deity in whose service they are enrolled, and they announce
his will. In his name they threaten evil-doers with
punishment, and promise rewards to the faithful and obedient.
Benefits from on high are declared to be the lot of those who
pay them honor. They proclaim the fact that their presence is
essential to the performance of important rites, and that their
assistance at these must be duly rewarded. Sometimes they are
in possession of knowledge which is only permitted to be imparted
to their own caste. They are at all times the authorized
expositors of theological dogma, and the authorized guardians
of public ritual.</p>

<p>Let us enter on a more detailed account of these several
characteristics of the priestly order.</p>

<p>First, it has to be noted that the differentiation of this order
from the rest of society is in primitive communities very incomplete.
Fathers of families, or any venerable and respected
men, act as priests, and perform the requirements of divine
worship according to their own notions of propriety. Thus in
Samoa, Mr. Turner tells us that "the father of the family was
<i>the high-priest</i>, and usually offered a short prayer at the evening
meal, that they might all be kept from fines, sickness, war, and
death." He also directed on what occasions religious festivals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139"> 139</span>
should be held, and it was supposed that the god sometimes
spoke through the father or another member of the family (N.
Y., p. 239). So in the early period of the history of the Israelites,
there was no formal and regular priesthood, and no established
ritual. The Levites were not devoted to the functions
they subsequently discharged, until, in the course of the Exodus,
they had proved their qualification by the holy zeal with
which they slaughtered their brethren. It was for the perpetration
of this massacre that they were promised by Moses the
blessing of God (Exod. xxxii. 25-29). With advancing culture,
the necessity for separating priests from laymen is always felt.
The ministrations of unskilled hands are not held to be sufficient.
Ritual grows fixed; and for a fixed ritual there must be
a special apprenticeship. Ceremonies multiply; and the original
family prayer having grown into a more elaborate system
of worship, takes more time, and demands the attention of a
class who make this, and kindred matters, their exclusive occupation.</p>

<p>While, however, the ministers of the gods are thus differentiated
from the people at large, they are not differentiated until
a later stage from the ministers of the human body. Medicine
and priestcraft are for a long time united arts. On this connection,
Brinton very justly remarks, that "when sickness is
looked upon as the effect of the anger of a god, or as the
malicious infliction of a sorcerer, it is natural to seek help from
those who assume to control the unseen world, and influence
the fiats of the Almighty" (M. N. W., p. 264). Thus in America
the native priests were called by the European colonists, "medicine
men." The New Zealand priests were "expert jugglers,"
and when called in to the sick would ascribe some diseases to a
piece of wood lodged in the stomach; this they pretended to
extract, and produced it in evidence of their assertion. An acquaintance
of the author from whom I borrow this fact, saw
one of these doctors tear open the leg of a rheumatic patient,
and (apparently) take out of it a knotted piece of wood (N. Z.,
p. 80). In the Fiji islands they occasionally use their medical
powers malevolently, instead of benevolently. In Tanna, there
was a class of men termed "disease-makers," and greatly
dreaded by the people, who thought that these men could exer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140"> 140</span>cise
the power of life and death, the calamity of death being
the result of burning rubbish belonging to the sufferer. When
a Tannese was ill, he believed that the disease-maker was burning
his rubbish, and would send large presents to induce him
to stop; for if it were all burned he would die (N. Y. p. 89-91).
The Samoans believed disease to be the result of divine wrath,
and sought its remedy at the hands of the high-priest of the
village. Whatever he might demand was given; in some cases,
however, he did not ask for anything, but merely commanded
the family of the patient to "confess, and throw out." Confessing,
and throwing out, consisted of a statement by each
member of the family of the crimes he had committed, or of
the evil he had invoked on the patient or his connections, accompanied
by the ceremony of spurting out water from the
mouth towards him (N. Y., p. 224). Like the Fijians, the natives
of Australia employ priests to cure their illnesses. Their ecclesiastical
practitioners "perform incantations over the sick," and
also pretend to suck out the disease, producing a piece of bone
which they assert to be its cause (S. L. A., p. 226). The Africans
have an exactly similar belief in the influence of fetish
over disease. Reade observes that epileptic attacks are (as is
natural from their mysterious character) ascribed to demoniacal
possession, and that fetish-men are called in to cure them. This
they attempt to accomplish by elaborate dances and festivities,
"at the expense of the next of kin," which sometimes end in
driving the patient into the bush in a state of complete insanity.
When cured, he "builds a little fetish-house, avoids certain
kinds of food, and performs certain duties" (S. A., p. 251).
The negroes on the coast of Guinea, when ill, apply to their
priest, who informs them what offerings are required to ensure
their recovery (D. C. G., p. 213). When an Amazulu is troubled
by bad dreams, he applies to a diviner, who recommends certain
ceremonies by which the spirit causing the dreams is supposed
to be banished. Should he be ill, his friends apply to the
diviner, who discovers the source of the illness, and probably
demands the sacrifice of a bullock. A remarkable sensitiveness
about the shoulders indicates the spiritual character of the doctor.
If he fail to remove disease, he is said to have no "Itongo,"
or spirit, in him (R. S. A., pt. ii. pp. 159, 160, 172). The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141"> 141</span>
Fida negroes sent to consult their divine snake through a priest
when ill, and the priest (unless he announced that the disease
would be fatal) received a reward for indicating the remedies to
be used. Moreover, the priests were the physicians of the negroes.
Two theories prevailed among the people as to the origin
of illnesses. Some tribes held them to be due to evil spirits,
who were accordingly driven away by a prescribed system of
armed pursuit. But the priests in other places regarded them
as a consequence of discord between spirit and soul, and required
the patient in the first instance to confess his sins. This being
done, they obtain from their deity an indication of the offerings
to be made, or the vows to be fulfilled, to restore mental harmony.
They then undertook the treatment of the body by
physical means (G. d. M., pp. 335, 336). In Sierra Leone, as in
other parts of Africa, "the practice of medicine, and the art of
making greegrees and fetishes, in other words, amulets ...
is generally the province of the same person." Those who
practice medicine are looked upon as witches, and believed not
only to converse with evil spirits, but to exercise control over
them (N. A., vol. i. p. 251). In New France, in the eighteenth
century, the principal occupation of the native priests was medicine
(N. F. vol. iii. p. 364). In Mexico, the people came from
all parts to the priests to be anointed with the peculiar unguent
used in the special consecration mentioned above (<i>Supra</i>,
p. 116). This they termed a "divine physic," and considered as
a cure for their diseases (H. I., b. 5, ch. 26).</p>

<p>Such rude notions as these, implying a supernatural as opposed
to a natural theory of the physical conditions of the body,
are not wholly extinct even among ourselves. They exist, like
so many of the crude conceptions of the savage, in the form of
respected survivals wholly inconsistent with our practical habits.
True, we do not call in the clergyman to assist or to direct at
the sick-bed. But we do ask him to put up prayers for the
recovery of the sick; and in the case of royal princes, the clergy
throughout the land are set to work to induce the divine Being
to give their illnesses a favorable turn. Now, this proceeding,
however disguised under refined and imposing forms, is practically
on a level with that of the Amazulu, who seeks to pacify
the offended spirit that has attacked him with pain by the sac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142"> 142</span>rifice
of a bullock; or with that of the Fijian who, when his
friend is ill, blows a shell for hours as a call to the disease-maker
to stop burning the sick man's rubbish, and as a sign
that presents will speedily reach his hands. Nay, the very missionary
who relates this Fiji custom gives at least one proof of
his fitness to understand the native mind, in a passage showing
that in reference to beliefs like these his own was almost on a
par with it. A war, of which the missionaries disapproved, had
been going on for four months, "and the end of it was, the war
was raised against ourselves. After they had been fighting for
months among themselves, contrary to all our entreaties, God
commenced to punish them with a deadly epidemic in the form
of dysentery." Now, the conviction that diseases are punishments
sent by some god, or at any rate direct results of an
intention on the part of some god to harm the sufferer, is at
the root of the priestly, as opposed to the scientific, treatment.
For if God punishes with a deadly epidemic, it is an obvious
inference that the mode of cure and of prevention is not to take
physical remedies, and observe physical precautions, but to
avoid the sin for which the punishment is given. And this is
the common conclusion of the savage and the Christian, though
the superior information of the Christian renders his conduct
self-contradictory and confused, where that of the savage is
logical and simple.</p>

<p>Nearly related to the supposed influence of priests over physical
suffering, is their supposed power to foretell the future.
Here, however, a number of unauthorized and schismatic priesthoods
often enter into competition with those sanctioned by the
state. Technically, they would not be termed priests at all; but
tested by the true mark of priesthood, the gift, alleged by themselves
and admitted by others, of forming channels of communication
from the celestial powers to man, they are entitled to
that name, and this although they may perhaps receive no regular
consecration to their office. The Roman Senate during the
Empire came into frequent collision with these irregular priests.
It endeavored from time to time to combat the growing belief
in the unorthodox practices of astrologers and magi, by decreeing
their expulsion from Italy, and occasionally by visiting some
of them with severer penalties; but such endeavors to stem the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143"> 143</span>
tide of popular superstition are naturally useless (Tac. Ann., ii.
32; xii. 52). Magic of some description is universal. In New
Zealand the priest "seems to unite in his person the offices of
priest, sorcerer, juggler, and physician." He predicts the life or
death of members of his tribe (N. Z., p. 80). By the Kafirs the
prophet is consulted on all kinds of domestic occasions, and
(while the people beat the ground in assent to what he says) he
is held to see in a vision the event which has led to the consultation
(K. N., p. 167 ff). The inhabitants of Sierra Leone have
other methods of divining. Their diviners make dots and lines
in sand spread upon a goat's skin, which dots and lines they
afterwards decipher; or they place palm-nuts in heaps upon
a goat's skin, and by shifting them about suppose that an answer
is obtained (N. A., vol. i. p. 134). The heathen Mexican
had the habit, on the birth of a child, of consulting a diviner
in order to ascertain its future. The diviner, having learnt from
the child's parents the hour at which it was born, turned over
his books to discover the sign under which its nativity had
occurred. Should that sign prove to be favorable, he would say
to the parents: "Your child has been born under a good sign;
it will be a senor, or senator, or rich, or brave," or will have
some other distinction. In the opposite case he would say:
"The child has not been born under a good sign; it has been
born under a disastrous sign." In some circumstances there
was hope that the evil might be remedied; but if the sign were
altogether bad, they would predict that it would be vicious,
carnal, and a thief; or that it would be dull and lazy; or possibly
that it would be a great drunkard; or that its life would
be short. A third alternative was when the sign was indifferent,
and the expected fortune was therefore partly good and partly
bad. The diviner, in this case and in that of a bad, but not
hopelessly bad, sign, assisted the parents by pointing out an auspicious
day for the baptism of the infant (A. M., vol. v. pp.
479, 480).</p>

<p>Prediction of coming events was practiced by the priests in
North America, as it was elsewhere. They persuaded the multitude,
says Charlevoix, that they suffered from ecstatic transports.
During these conditions, they said that their spirits
gave them a large acquaintance with remote things, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144"> 144</span>
the future (N. F., vol. iii. p. 347). Moreover, they practiced
magic, and with such effect that Charlevoix felt himself compelled
to ascribe their performances to their alliance with the
devil. They even pretended to be born in a supernatural manner,
and found believers ready to think that only by some sort
of enchantment and illusion had they formerly imagined that
they had come into the world like other people. When they
went into the state of ecstasy, they resembled the Pythoness on
the tripod; they assumed tones of voice and performed actions
which seemed beyond human capacity. On these occasions they
suffered so much that it was hard to induce them, even by
handsome payment, thus to yield themselves to the spirit. So
often did they prophesy truly, that Charlevoix can only resort
again to his hypothesis of a real intercourse between them and
the "father of seduction and of lies," who manifested his connection
with them by telling them the truth. Thus, a lady named
Madame de Marson, by no means an "esprit faible," was
anxious about her husband, who was commanding at a French
outpost in Acadia, and who had stayed away beyond the time
fixed for his return. A native woman, having ascertained the
reason of her trouble, told her not to be distressed, for that
her husband would return on a certain day at a certain hour,
wearing a grey hat. Seeing that the lady did not believe in
her, she returned on the day and at the hour named, and asked
her if she would not come to meet her husband. After much
pressing, she induced the lady to accompany her to the bank
of the river. Scarcely had they arrived, when M. de Marson
appeared in a canoe, wearing a grey hat upon his head. The
writer was informed of this fact by Madame de Marson's son-in-law,
at that time Governor-General of the French dominions
in America, who had heard it from herself (N. F., vol. iii. p.
359-363). The priests of the Tartars are also their diviners.
They predict eclipses, and announce lucky and unlucky days
for all sorts of business (Bergeron, Voyage de Rubruquis, ch. 47).</p>

<p>Among the Buddhist priesthood of Thibet, there is a class
of Lamas who are astrologers, distinguished by a peculiar dress,
and making it their business to tell fortunes, exorcise evil
spirits, and so forth. The astrologers "are considered to have
intercourse with Sadag," a spirit who is supposed to be "lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145"> 145</span>
of the ground," in which bodies are interred, and who, along
with other spirits, requires to be pacified by charms and rites
known only to these priests. To prevent them from injuring
the dead, the relations offer a price in cattle or money to Sadag;
and the astrologers, when satisfied with the amount, undertake
the necessary conjuration (B. T., pp. 156, 271).</p>

<p>In the Old Testament, this class of unofficial priests is mentioned
with the reprobation inspired by rivalry. The Hebrew
legislator is at one with the Roman Senate in his desire to expel
them from the land. "There shall not be found among you any
one that ... useth divination, or an observer of times, or an
enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consultor with familiar
spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these
things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these
abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from
before thee" (Deut. xviii. 10-12). The very prohibition evinces
the existence of the objects against whom it is aimed; and
proves that, along with the recognized worship of Jehovah,
there existed an unrecognized resort to practices which the
sterner adherents of that worship would not permit.</p>

<p>In addition to their claim to be in possession of special
means of ascertaining the occult causes of phenomena (as in illness),
and of special contrivances for penetrating the future (as
in astrology or fortune-telling), priesthoods pretend to a more
direct inspiration from on high, qualifying them either to announce
the will of their god on exceptional occasions, or to intimate
his purpose in matters of more ordinary occurrence.
This inspiration was granted to the native North American
priests at the critical age of puberty, "It was revealed to its
possessor by the character of the visions he perceived at the
ordeal he passed through on arriving at puberty; and by the
northern nations was said to be the manifestation of a more
potent personal spirit than ordinary. It was not a faculty, but
an inspiration; not an inborn strength, but a spiritual gift"
(M. N. W., p. 279). So in India; among the several meanings
of the word Brahman, is that of a person "elected by special
divine favor to receive the gift of inspiration" (O. S. T., vol. i.
p. 259). The missionary Turner, who has an eye for parallels,
observes, among other just reflections, that "the way in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146"> 146</span>
the Samoan priests declared that the gods spoke by them,
strikingly reminds us of the mode by which God of old made
known his will to man by the Hebrew prophets" (N. Y., p. 349).
Although the Levites were said to be the Lord's, and to have
been hallowed by him instead of all the first-born of Israel, yet
it does not appear that they were in general endowed with any
high order of inspiration. The high-priest no doubt received
communications from God by the Urim and Thummim. Priests
were also the judges whom the Lord chose, and whose sentence
in court was to be obeyed on penalty of death; but the inspiration
that was fitted to guide the Israelites was supplied not so
much by them as by the prophets, a kind of supplementary
priesthood of which the members, sometimes priests, sometimes
consecrated by other prophets, were as a rule unconsecrated,
deriving their appointment directly from Jehovah. While,
therefore, it was attained in a somewhat unusual way, the general
need of an inspired order was supplied no less perfectly
among the Israelites than elsewhere. Christian priests enjoy
two kinds of inspiration. In the first place, they are inspired
specially when assembled in general councils, to declare the
truth in matters of doctrine, or in other words, to issue supplementary
revelations; in the second place, they are inspired
generally to remit or retain offenses, their sentence being—according
to the common doctrine of Catholics and Episcopalian
Protestants—always ratified in the Court above.</p>

<p>Consistently with this exalted conception of their authority,
priestly orders threaten punishment to offenders, and announce
the future destiny of souls. Thus the Mexican priests warned
their penitents after confession not to fall again into sin, holding
out the prospect of the torments of hell if they should
neglect the admonition (A. M., vol. v, p. 370). The priests in
some parts of Africa know the fate of each soul after death, and
can say whether it has gone to God or to the evil spirit (G. d.
M., p. 335).</p>

<p>Sometimes the priests are held to be protected against injury
by the especial care of heaven. To take away a Brahman's
wife is an offense involving terrible calamities, while kings who
restore her to the Brahman enjoy "the abundance of the
earth" (0. S. T., vol. i. p. 257). A king who should eat a Brah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147"> 147</span>man's
cow is warned in solemn language of the dreadful consequences
of such conduct, both in this world and the next (Ibid.,
vol. i. p. 285). The sacred volumes declare that "whenever a
king, fancying himself mighty, seeks to devour a Brahman,
that kingdom is broken up, in which a Brahman is oppressed"
(Ibid., vol. i. p. 287). "No one who has eaten a Brahman's cow
continues to watch (<i>i.e.</i>, to rule) over a country." The Indian
gods, moreover, "do not eat the food offered by a king who
has no ... Purohita," or domestic chaplain (A. B., p. 528).
The murder of a king who had honored and enriched the Buddhist
priesthood, is said to have entailed the destruction of the
power and strength of the kingdom of Thibet, and to have
extinguished the happiness and welfare of its people (G. O. M.,
p. 362). And Jewish history affords abundant instances of the
manner in which the success or glory of the rulers was connected,
by the sacerdotal class, with the respect shown towards
themselves as the ministers of Jehovah, and with the rigor
evinced in persecuting or putting down the ministers of every
other creed. That the same bias has been betrayed by the
Christian priesthood and their adherents in the interpretation
of history needs no proof.</p>

<p>The presence of a priest or priests at important rites is held
to be indispensable by all religions. With the negroes visited
by Oldendorp, the priest was in requisition at burials; for he
only could help the soul to get to God, and keep off the evil
spirit who would seek to obtain possession of it (G. d. M., p.
327). "For most of the ceremonies" (in Thibet) "the performance
by a Lama is considered indispensable to its due effect;
and even where this is not so, the efficacy of the rite is
increased by the Lama's assistance" (B. T., p. 247). Much the
same thing may be said here. For certain ceremonies, such as
confirmation, the administration of the sacrament, the conduct
of divine service on Sundays, the priest is a necessary official.
For others, such as marriage, the majority of the people prefer
to employ him, and no doubt believe that "the efficacy of the
rite is increased" by the fact that he reads the words of the
service. Nor is this surprising when we consider that, until
within very recent times, no legitimate child could be produced
in England without the assistance of a priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148"> 148</span></p>

<p>Not only is the ecclesiastical caste required to render religious
rites acceptable to the deity, but they are often endowed
with the attribute of ability to modify the course of nature.
Tanna, one of the Fiji group, "there are rain-makers and
thunder-makers, and fly and musquito makers, and a host of
other 'sacred men;'" and in another island "there is a rain-making
class of priests" (N. Y., pp. 89, 428). In Christian
countries all priests are rain-makers, the reading of prayers for
fine or wet weather being a portion of their established duties.</p>

<p>Naturally, the members of a class whose functions are of
this high value to the community enjoy great power, are
regarded as extremely sacred, and above all, are well rewarded.
First, as to the power they enjoy. This is accorded to them
alike by savage tribes and by cultivated Europeans. According
to Brinton, all North American tribes "appear to have been
controlled" by secret societies of priests. "Withal," says the
same authority, "there was no class of persons who so widely
and deeply influenced the culture, and shaped the destiny of
the Indian tribes, as their priests" (M. N. W., p. 285). Over
the negroes of the Caribbean Islands the priests and priestesses
exercised an almost unlimited dominion, being regarded with
the greatest reverence. No negro would have ventured to
transgress the arrangements made by a priest (G. d. M., p. 327).
On the coast of Guinea there exists, or existed, an institution
by which certain women became priestesses; and such women,
even though slaves before, enjoyed, on receiving this dignity, a
high position and even exercised absolute authority precisely in
the quarter where it must have been sweetest to their minds,
namely, over their husbands (D. C. G., p. 363). Writing of the
Talapoins in Siam, Gervaise says, that they are exempted from
all public charges; they salute nobody, while everybody prostrates
himself before them; they are maintained at the public
expense, and so forth (H. N. S., troisième partie, chs. 5, 6). Of
the enormous power wielded by the clerical order in Europe,
especially during the Middle Ages, it is unnecessary to speak.
The humiliation of Theodosius by Ambrose was one of the
most conspicuous, as it was one of the most beneficent, exercises
of their extensive rights.</p>

<p>Secondly, the sanctity attached to their persons is usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149"> 149</span>
considerable, and may often, to ambitious minds, afford a large
compensation for the loss (if such be required) of some kinds of
secular enjoyment. The African priestesses just mentioned are
"as much respected as the priest, or rather more," and call
themselves by the appellation of "God's children." When certain
Buddhist ecclesiastics were executed for rebellion in Ceylon,
the utmost astonishment was expressed by the people at
the temerity of the king in so treating "such holy and reverend
persons. And none heretofore," adds the reporter of the fact,
"have been so served; being reputed and called <i>sons of Boddon</i>"
(H. R. C., p. 75), or Buddha; a title exactly corresponding to
that of God's children bestowed upon the priestesses. In Siam
the "Talapoins," or priests, are of two kinds: secular, living in
the world; and regular, living in the forest without intercourse
with men. There is no limit to the veneration given by the
Siamese to these last, whom they look upon as demigods (H. N.
S., troisième partie, p. 184). "The Brahman caste," according
to the sacred books of the Hindus, "is sprung from the gods"
(O. S. T., vol. i. p. 21); and the exceptional honor always
accorded to them is in harmony with this theory of their
origin. The title "Reverend," man to be revered, given to the
clergy in Europe, implies the existence, at least originally, of a
similar sentiment of respect.</p>

<p>Lastly, the services of priests are generally well rewarded,
and they themselves take every care to encourage liberality
towards their order. Payment is made to them either in the
shape of direct remuneration, or in that of exceptional pecuniary
privileges, or in that of exemptions from burdens.
Direct remuneration may be, and often is, given in the shape
of a fixed portion abstracted from the property of the laity for
the benefit of the clergy. Such are the tithes bestowed by law
upon the latter among the Jews, the Parsees, and the Christians.
Or, direct remuneration may consist in fees for services
rendered, and in voluntary gifts. Such fees and gifts are always
represented by the priesthood as highly advantageous to the
givers. If the relatives of a deceased Parsee do not give the
priest who officiates at the funeral four new robes, the dead
will appear naked before the throne of God at the resurrection,
and will be put to shame before the whole assembly (Av., vol.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150"> 150</span>
ii. p. xli.; iii. p. xliv). Moreover, those Parsees who wish to
live happily, and have children who will do them honor, must
pay four priests, who during three days and three nights perform
the Yasna for them (Z. A., vol. ii. p. 564). In Thibet
there is great merit in consecrating a domestic animal to a certain
god, the animal being after a certain time "delivered to
the Lamas, who may eat it" (B. T., p. 158). Giving alms to the
monks is a duty most sedulously inculcated by Buddhism, and
the Buddhist writings abound in illustrations of the advantages
derived from the practice. Similar benefits accrue to the
clergy from the custom, prevailing in Ceylon, of making offerings
in the temples for recovery from sickness; for when the
Singhalese have left their gift on the altar, "the priest presents
it with all due ceremony to the god; and after its purpose is
thus served, very prudently converts it to his own use" (A I.
C., p. 205). Of the Levites it is solemnly declared in Deuteronomy
that they have "no part nor inheritance with Israel,"
and that "the Lord is their inheritance." But "the Lord" is
soon seen to be a very substantial inheritance indeed. From
those that offer an ox or a sheep the priests are to receive
"the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw;" while the
first-fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and the first of the sheep's
fleeces are to be given to them (Deut. xviii. 1-5). Moreover,
giving to the priest is declared to be the same thing as giving
to the Lord (Num. v. 8). A similar notion, always fostered by
ecclesiastical influence, has led to the vast endowments bestowed
by pious monarchs and wealthy individuals upon the Christian
clergy.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the priests enjoy exemptions from the taxes, or
other burdens levied upon ordinary people. A singular instance
of this is found in the privilege of the Parsee priests, of not
paying their doctors (J. A., vol. ii. p. 555). Large immunities
used to be enjoyed by ecclesiastics among ourselves, especially
that of exemption from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts
of law.</p>

<p>While the life of a priest often entails certain privations, he
is nevertheless frequently sustained by the thought that there
is merit in the sacrifices he makes. Thus, it is held by a Buddhist
authority, that the merit obtained by entering the spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151"> 151</span>
order is very great; and that his merit is immeasurable who
either permits a son, a daughter, or a slave, to enter it, or
enters it himself (W. u. T., p. 107).</p>

<p>Priesthoods may either be hereditary or selected. The Brahmins
in India, and the Levites in Judæa, are remarkable types
of hereditary, the Buddhist and the Christian clergy of selected,
sacerdotal orders. Curious modifications of the hereditary principle
were found among the American Indians. Thus, "among
the Nez Percés of Oregon," the priestly office "was transmitted
in one family from father to son and daughter, but, always with
the proviso that the children at the proper age reported dreams
of a satisfactory character." The Shawnees "confined it to one
<i>totem</i>:" but just as the Hebrew prophets need not be Levites,
"the greatest of their prophets ... was not a member of
this clan." The Cherokees "had one family set apart for the
priestly office," and when they "abused their birthright" and
were all massacred, another family took their places. With another
tribe, the Choctaws, the office of high-priest remained in
one family, passing from father to son; "and the very influential
piaches of the Carib tribes very generally transmitted their
rank and position to their children." A more important case
of hereditary priesthood is that of the Incas of Peru, who monopolized
the highest offices both in Church and State. "In
ancient Anahuac" there existed a double system of inheritance
and selection. The priests of Huitzilopochtli, "and perhaps a
few other gods," were hereditary; and the high-priest of that
god, towards whom the whole order was required to observe implicit
obedience, was the "hereditary pontifex maximus." But
the rest were dedicated to ecclesiastical life from early childhood,
and were carefully educated for the profession (M. N. W.,
p. 281-291).</p>

<p>Christianity entirely abandoned the hereditary principle prevalent
among its spiritual ancestors, the Jews, and selected for
its ministers of religion those who felt, or professed to feel, an
internal vocation for this career. Doubtless this is the most
effectual plan for securing a powerful priesthood. Those who
belong to it have their heart far more thoroughly in their work
than can possibly be the case when it falls to them by right of
birth. Just the most priestly-minded of the community become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152"> 152</span>
priests; and a far greater air of zeal and of sanctity attaches
to an order thus maintained, than to one of which many of the
members possess no qualification but that of family, tribe, or
caste.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more irrational than the denunciation of
priests and priestcraft which is often indulged in by Liberal
writers and politicians. If it be true that priests have shown
considerable cunning, it is also true that the people have fostered
that cunning by credulity. And if the clergy have put
forth very large pretensions to inspiration, divine authority, and
hidden knowledge, it is equally the fact that the laity have demanded
such qualifications at their hands. An order can
scarcely be blamed if it seeks to satisfy the claims which the
popular religion makes upon it. Enlightenment from heaven
has in all ages and countries been positively demanded. Sacrifices
have always had to be made; and when it was found more
convenient to delegate the function of offering them to a class
apart, that class naturally established ritualistic rules of their
own, and as naturally asserted (and no doubt believed) that all
sacrifices not offered according to these rules were displeasing
to God. And they could not profess the inspiration which they
were expected to manifest without also requiring obedience to
divine commands. Priests are, in fact, the mere outcome of
religious belief as it commonly exists; and partly minister to
that belief by deliberate trickery, partly share it themselves,
and honestly accept the accredited view of their own lofty commission.</p>

<p>Divine inspiration leads by a very logical process to infallibility.
A Church founded on revelation needs living teachers to
preserve the correct interpretation of that revelation. Without
such living teachers, revealed truth itself becomes (as it always
has done among Protestants) an occasion of discord and of
schism. But the interpreters of revelation in their turn must
be able to appeal to some sole and supreme authority, as the
arbiter between varying opinions, and the guide to be followed
through all the intricacies of dogma. Nowhere can such an arbiter
and such a guide be found more naturally than in the
head of the Church himself. If God speaks to mankind through
his Church, it is only a logical conclusion that within that Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153"> 153</span>
there must be one through whom he speaks with absolute certainty,
and whose prophetic voice must therefore be infallible.
There cannot be a more consistent application of the general
theory of priesthood; and there is no more fatal sign for the
prospects of Christianity than the inability of many of its supporters
to accept so useful a doctrine, and the thoughtless indignation
of some among them against the single Church which
has had the wisdom to proclaim it.</p>

<p>Although for the ordinary and regular communications from
the divine Being to man the established priesthoods might suffice,
yet occasions arise when there is need of a plenipotentiary
with higher authority and more extensive powers. What is
required of these exceptional ambassadors is not merely to repeat
the doctrines of the old religion, but to establish a new
one. In other words, they are the original founders of the
great religions of the world. Of such founders there is but a
very limited number.</p>

<p>Beginning with China, and proceeding from East to West, we
find six:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. <span class="smcap">Confucius</span>, or <span class="smcap">Khung-fu-tsze</span>, the founder of Confucianism.</li>
<li>2. <span class="smcap">Laò-tsé</span>, the founder of Taouism.</li>
<li>3. <span class="smcap">Sakyamuni</span>, or <span class="smcap">Gautama Buddha</span>, the founder of Buddhism.</li>
<li>4. <span class="smcap">Zarathustra</span>, or <span class="smcap">Zoroaster</span>, the founder of Parseeism.</li>
<li>5. <span class="smcap">Mohammed</span>, or <span class="smcap">Mahomet</span>, the founder of Islamism.</li>
<li>6. <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, the founder of Christianity.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these men, whom for convenience sake I propose to call
<i>prophets</i>, occupy an entirely exceptional position in the history
of the human race. The characteristics, or marks, by which
they may be distinguished from other great men, are partly
external, belonging to the views of others about them; partly
internal, belonging to their own view about themselves.</p>

<p>1. The first external mark by which they are distinguished
is, that within his own religion each of these is recognized as
the highest known authority. They alone are thought of as
having the right to change what is established. While all other
teachers appeal to them for the sanction of their doctrines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155"> 155</span>
there is no appeal from them to any one beyond. What they
have said is final. They are in perfect possession of the truth.
Others are in possession of it only in so far as they agree with
them. No doubt, the sacred books are equally infallible with
the prophets; but the sacred books of religions founded by
prophets derive their authority in the last resort from them,
and are always held to be only a written statement of their
teaching. Thus, the sacred books of China are partly of direct
Confucian authorship; partly by others who recognize him as
their head. The only sacred book of the Tao-tsé is by their
founder himself. The sacred books of the Buddhists are supposed
discourses of the Buddha. The Avesta is the reputed
work of Zarathustra. The Koran is the actual work of Mahomet.
And lastly, the New Testament is all of it written in express
subordination to the authority of Christ, to which it constantly
appeals. These books, then, are infallible, because they contain
the doctrines of their founders.</p>

<p>The same thing is true where there is an infallible Church.
The Church never claims the same absolute authority as it concedes
to its prophet. Its infallibility consists in its power to
interpret correctly the mind of him by whom it was established.
He it is who brought the message from above which no human
power could have discovered. It is the Church's function to explain
that message to the world; and, where needed, to deduce
such inferences therefrom as by its supernatural inspiration it
perceives to be just. Beyond this, the power of the Church
does not extend.</p>

<p>A second external mark, closely related to the first, is, that
the prophet of each religion is, within the limits of that religion,
the object of a more or less mythical delineation of his
personality. His historical form is, to some extent, superseded
by the form bestowed upon him by a dogmatic legend. According
to that legend there was something about his nature that
was more than human. He was in some way extraordinary.
The myths related vary from a mere exaltation of the common
features of humanity, to the invention of completely supernatural
attributes. But their object is the same: to represent their
prophet as more highly endowed than other mortals. Even
where there is little of absolute myth, the representation we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156"> 156</span>
receive is one-sided; we know nothing of the prophet's faults,
except in so far as we may discover them against the will of the
biographers. To them he appears all-virtuous. These remarks
will be abundantly illustrated when we come to consider the
life of Jesus, and to compare it with that of his compeers.</p>

<p>2. The internal mark corresponds to the first external mark,
of which it is indeed the subjective counterpart. These prophets
conceive themselves deputed to teach a faith, and they virtually
recognize in the performance of this mission no human authority
superior to their own. In words, perhaps, they do acknowledge
some established authority; but in fact they set it aside.
No Church or priesthood has the smallest weight with them, as
opposed to that intense internal conviction which appears to
them an inspiration. Hence it was observed of Jesus, that he
taught with authority, and not as the scribes. Without being
able themselves to give any explanation of the fact, they feel
themselves endowed with plenary power to reform. And it is
not, like other reformers, in the name of another that they do
this; they reform in their own right, and with no other title
than their own profound consciousness of being not only permitted,
but charged to do it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must not be imagined that the prophets
sweep away everything they find in the existing religion. On
the contrary, it will be found on examination that they always
retain some important element or elements of the older faith.
Without this, they would have no hold on the popular mind of
their country, from which they would be too far removed to
make themselves understood. Thus, Allah was already recognized
as God by the Arabians in the time of Mahomet, whose
reform consisted in teaching that he was the only God. Thus,
the Messiah was already expected by the Jews in the time of
Jesus, whose reform consisted in applying the expectation to
himself. Prophets take advantage of a faith already in existence,
and making that the foundation of a new religion, erect
upon it the more special truths they are inspired to proclaim.</p>

<p>No prophet can construct a religion entirely from his own
brain. Were he to do so, he would be unable to show any reason
why it should be accepted. There would be no feeling in
the minds of his hearers to which he could appeal. A religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157"> 157</span>
to be accepted by any but an insignificant fraction, must find
a response not only in the intellects, but in the emotions of
those for whom it is designed.</p>

<p>This, it appears to me, is the weak point of Positivism.
Auguste Comte, having abolished all that in the general mind
constitutes religion at all, attempted to compose a faith for
his disciples by the merely arbitrary exercise of his own ingenuity.
He perhaps did not consider that in all history there is
no example of a religion being invented by an individual
thinker. It is like attempting to sell a commodity for which
there is no demand. Even if his philosophical principles should
be accepted by the whole of Europe, there can be no reason
why the special observances he recommends should be adopted,
or the special saints whom he places in the calendar be adored.
Those who receive his philosophy will have no need for his ceremonies.
While even if ceremonies cannot be entirely dispensed
with, it is not the mere fact of a solitary thinker planning
it in his own mind that can ever ensure the adoption of a
ritual.</p>

<p>Very different has been the procedure of the prophets of
whom we are now to speak. Intellectually, they were no doubt
far inferior to the founder of the Positive Philosophy. But
emotionally, they were fitted for the part which he unsuccessfully
endeavored to play. They entered into the religious feelings
of their countrymen, and gave those feelings a higher
expression than had yet been found for them. Instinctively fixing
on some conspicuous part of the old religion, they made
that the starting-point for the development of the new. They
reformed, but the reformation linked itself to some conviction
that was already deeply rooted in the nature of their converts.
They assumed boundless authority; but it was authority to proclaim
a pre-existing truth, not to spin out of their purely personal
ideas of fitness a system altogether disconnected from the
past evolution of religion, and to impose that system upon the
remainder of mankind.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section I.</span>—<span class="smcap">Confucius.</span><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h4>

<p>The life of the prophet of China is not eventful. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158"> 158</span>
neither the charm of philosophic placidity and retirement from
the world which belongs to that of Laò-tsé, nor the romantic
interest of the more varied careers of Sakyamuni, Christ, or
Mahomet. For Confucius, though a philosopher, did not object,
indeed rather desired, to take some share in the government of
his country, but his wishes received very little gratification.
Rulers refused to acquiesce in his principles of administration,
and he was compelled to rely for their propagation mainly on
the oral instruction imparted to his disciples. His life, therefore,
bears to some extent the aspect of a failure, though for
this appearance he himself is not to blame. Another cause,
which somewhat diminishes the interest we might otherwise
take in him, is his excessive attention to proprieties, ceremonies,
and rites. We cannot but feel that a truly great man,
even in China, would have emancipated himself from the bondage
of such trifles. Nevertheless, after all deductions are made,
enough remains to render the career and character of Confucius
deserving of attention, and in many respects of admiration.</p>

<p>Descended from a family which had formerly been powerful
and noble, but was now in comparatively modest circumstances,
he was born in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 551, his father's name being Shuh-leang
Heih, and his mother's Ching-Tsae. The legends related of his
nativity I pass over for the present. His father, who was an
old man when he was born, died when the child was in his
third year; and his mother in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 528. At nineteen, Confucius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159"> 159</span>
was married; and at twenty-one he came forward as a teacher.
Disciples attached themselves to him, and during his long
career as a philosopher, we find him constantly attended by
some faithful friends, who receive all he says with unbounded
deference, and propose questions for his decision as to an
authority against whom there can be no appeal. The maxims
of Confucius did not refer solely to ethics or to religion; they
bore largely upon the art of government, and he was desirous
if possible of putting them in actual practice in the administration
of public affairs. China, however, was in a state of great
confusion in his days; there were rebellions and wars in progress:
and the character of the rulers from whom he might
have obtained employment was such, that he could not, consistently
with the high standard of honor on which he always
acted, accept favors at their hands. One of them proposed to
grant him a town with its revenues; but Confucius said: "A
superior man will only receive reward for services which he has
done. I have given advice to the duke Ting (see below), but he has not
obeyed it, and now he would endow me with this place! very
far is he from understanding me" (C. C., vol. i., Prolegomena,
p. 68). In the year 500 the means were at length put within his
reach of carrying his views into practice. He was made "chief
magistrate of a town" in the state of Loo; and this first appointment
was followed by that of "assistant-superintendent of
works," and subsequently by that of "minister of crime." In
this office he is said to have put an end to crime altogether;
but Dr. Legge rightly warns us against confiding in the "indiscriminating
eulogies" of his disciples. A more substantial service
attributed to him is that of procuring the dismantlement of
two fortified towns which were the refuge of dangerous and
warlike chiefs. But his reforming government was brought to
an end after a few years by the weakness of his sovereign,
duke Ting, who was captivated by a present of eighty beautiful
and accomplished girls, and one hundred and twenty horses,
from a neighboring State. Engrossed by this present, the
duke neglected public affairs, and the philosopher felt bound to
resign.</p>

<p>We need not follow him during the long wanderings through
various parts of China which followed upon this disappoint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160"> 160</span>ment.
After traveling from State to State for many years, he
returned in his sixty-ninth year to Loo, but not to office. In
the year 478 his sad and troubled life was closed by death.</p>

<p>Our information respecting the character of Confucius is
ample. From the book which Dr. Legge has entitled the "Confucian
Analects," a collection of his sayings made (as he
believes) by the disciples of his disciples, we obtain the most
minute particulars both as to his personal habits and as to the
nature of his teaching. The impression derived from these
accounts is that of a gentle, virtuous, benevolent, and eminently
honorable man; a man who, like Socrates, was indifferent to
the reward received for his tuition, though not refusing payment
altogether; who would never sacrifice a single principle for the
sake of his individual advantage; yet who was anxious, if possible,
to benefit the kingdom by the establishment of an administration
penetrated with those ethical maxims which he conceived
to be all-important. Yet, irreproachable as his moral
character was, there is about him a deficiency of that bold originality
which has characterized the greatest prophets of other
nations. Sakyamuni revolted against the restrictions of caste
which dominated all minds in India. Jesus boldly claimed for
moral conduct a rank far superior to that of every ceremonial
obligation, even those which were held the most sacred by his
countrymen. Mahomet, morally far below the Chinese sage,
evinced a far more independent genius by his attack on the
prevalent idolatry of Mecca. Confucius did nothing of this kind.
His was a mind which looked back longingly to antiquity, and
imagined that it discovered in the ancient rulers and the ancient
modes of action, the models of perfection which all later times
should strive to follow. Nor was this all. He was so profoundly
under the influence of Chinese ways of thinking, as to attach
an almost ludicrous importance to a precise conformity to certain
rules of propriety, and to regard the exactitude with which
ceremonies were performed as matter of the highest concern.
In fact, he could not emancipate himself from the traditions of
his country; and his principles would have resulted rather in
making his followers perfect Chinamen than perfect men.</p>

<p>A far more serious charge is indeed brought against him by
Dr. Legge—that of insincerity (C. C., vol. i.—Prolegomena<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161"> 161</span>—
p. 101). I hesitate to impugn the opinion of so competent a
scholar; yet the evidence he has produced does not seem to me
sufficient to sustain the indictment. Granting that he gave an
unwelcome visitor the excuse of sickness, which was untrue,
still, as we are ignorant of the reasons which led him to decline
seeing the person in question, we cannot estimate the force of
the motives that induced him to put forward a plea in conformity
with the polite customs of his country. It does not appear,
moreover, that he practiced an intentional deceit. And though
on one occasion he may have violated an oath extorted by
rebels who had him in their power, therein acting wrongly (as
I think), it is always an open question how far promises made
under such circumstances are binding on the conscience. Whatever
failings, however, it may be necessary to admit, there can
be no question of the preëminent purity alike of his life and
doctrine. His is a character which, be its imperfections what
they may, we cannot help loving; and there have been few,
indeed, who would not have been benefited by the attempt to
reach even that standard of virtue which he held up to the
admiration of his disciples.</p>

<p>A few quotations from the works in which his words and
actions are preserved, will illustrate these remarks. In the
tenth Book of the Analects (C. C., vol. i. p. 91-100), his manners,
his garments, his mode of behavior under various circumstances,
are elaborately described. There are not many personages in
history of whom we have so minute a knowledge. We learn
that "in his village" he "looked simple and sincere, and as if
he were not able to speak." His reverence for his superiors
seems to have been profound. "When the prince was present,
his manner displayed respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but
self-possessed." When going to an audience of the prince, "he
ascended the dais, holding up his robe with both his hands,
and his body bent; holding in his breath also, as if he dared
not breathe. When he came out <i>from the audience</i> (the italics,
here and elsewhere, are in Legge), as soon as he had descended
one step, he began to relax his countenance, and had a satisfied
look. When he had got to the bottom of the steps, he advanced
rapidly to his place, <i>with his arms</i> like wings, and on occupying
it, his manner <i>still</i> showed respectful uneasiness." He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162"> 162</span>
rather particular about his food, rejecting meat unless "cut
properly," and with "its proper sauce."</p>

<p>Whatever he might be eating, however, "he would offer a
little of it in sacrifice." "When any of his friends died, if the
deceased had no relations who could be depended on for the
necessary offices, he would say, 'I will bury him.'" "In bed,
he did not lie like a corpse." And it is satisfactory to learn of
one who was such a respecter of formalities, that "at home he
did not put on any formal deportment." Notwithstanding this,
he does not appear to have been on very intimate terms with
his son, to whom he is reported to have said that unless he
learned "the odes" he would not be fit to converse with; and
that unless he learned "the rules of propriety" his character
could not be established. The disciple, who was informed by
the son himself that he had never heard from his father any
other special doctrine, was probably right in concluding that
"the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son"
(Lun Yu, xvi. 13).</p>

<p>But with his beloved disciples Confucius was on terms of
affectionate intimacy which does not seem to have been marred
by "the rules of propriety." For the death of one of them at
least he mourned so bitterly as to draw down upon himself the
expostulation of those who remained (Ibid., xi. 9). The picture
of the Master, accompanied at all times by his faithful friends,
who hang upon his lips, and eagerly gather up his every utterance,
is on the whole a pleasant one. "Do you think, my disciples,"
he asks, "that I have any concealments? I conceal
nothing from you. There is nothing that I do which is not
shown to you, my disciples;—that is my way" (Ibid., vii. 23).
And with all the homage he is constantly receiving, Confucius
is never arrogant. He never speaks like a man who wishes to
enforce his views in an authoritative style on others; never
threatens punishment either here or hereafter to those who dissent
from him.</p>

<p>"There were four things," his disciples tell us, "from which
the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions,
no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism"
(Lun Yu, ix. 4). And his conduct is entirely in harmony with
this statement. It is as a learner, rather than a teacher, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163"> 163</span>
he regards himself. "The Master said, 'When I walk along
with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select
their good qualities, and follow them; their bad qualities, and
avoid them'" (Ibid., vii. 21). Or again: "The sage and the
man of perfect virtue, how dare I <i>rank myself with them</i>? It
may simply be said of me, that I strive to become such without
satiety, and teach others without weariness" (Ibid., vii. 33). "In
letters I am perhaps equal to other men, but <i>the character</i> of
the superior man, carrying out in his conduct what he professes,
is what I have not yet attained to" (Ibid., vii. 32).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this modesty, there are traces—few indeed,
but not obscure—of that conviction of a peculiar mission which
all great prophets have entertained, and without which even
Confucius would scarcely have been ranked among them. The
most distinct of these is the following passage:—"The Master
was put in fear in K'wang. He said, 'After the death of king
Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here <i>in me</i>? If Heaven
had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future
mortal, should not have got such a relation to that cause.
While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can
the people of K'wang do to me?'" (Lun Yu, ix. 5). These
remarkable words would be conclusive, if they stood alone. But
they do not stand alone. In another place we find him thus
lamenting the pain of being generally misunderstood, which is
apt to be so keenly felt by exalted and sensitive natures. "The
Master said, 'Alas! there is no one that knows me.' Tse-kung
said, 'What do you mean by thus saying—that no one knows
you?' The Master replied, 'I do not murmur against Heaven.
I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and my
penetration rises high. But there is Heaven;—that knows
me!'" (Ibid., xiv. 37). Men might reject his labors and despise
his teaching, but he would complain neither against Heaven
nor against them. If he was not known by men, he was known
by Heaven, and that was enough. On another occasion, "the
Master said, 'Heaven produced the virtue that is in me, Hwan
T'uy—what can he do to me?'"<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164"> 164</span></p>

<p>These passages are the more remarkable, because Confucius
was not in the ordinary sense a believer in God. That is, he
never, throughout his instructions, says a single word implying
acknowledgment of a personal Deity; a Creator of the world;
a Being whom we are bound to worship as the author of our
lives and the ruler of our destinies. He has even been suspected
of omitting from his edition of the Shoo-king and the
She-king everything that could support the comparatively theistic
doctrine of his contemporary, Laò-tsé (By V. von Strauss,
T. T. K., p. xxxviii). That his high respect for antiquity would
have permitted such a procedure is, to say the least, very improbable;
and Dr. Legge is no doubt right in acquitting him of
any willful suppression of, or addition to, the ancient articles of
Chinese faith (C. C., vol. i. Prolegomena, p. 99). For our present
purpose it is enough to note that he avoided all discussion
on the higher problems of religion; and contented himself with
speaking, and that but rarely, of a vague, and hardly personal
Being which he called Heaven. Thus, in a book attributed (perhaps
erroneously) to his grandson, he is reported as saying,
"Sincerity is the very way of Heaven" (Chung Yung, xx. 18).
Of king Woo and the duke of Chow, two ancient worthies, he
says: "By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth
they served God" (where he seems to distinguish between
Heaven and God, whom I believe he never mentions but here);
"and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed
to their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the
sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several
sacrifices to ancestors, would find the government of a
kingdom as easy as to look into his palm" (Ibid., xix. 6). Elsewhere,
he remarks that "he who is greatly virtuous will be
sure to receive the appointment of heaven" (Ibid., xvii. 5).
Again: "Heaven, in the production of things, is surely bountiful
to them, according to their qualities" (Ibid., xvii. 3). Nothing
very definite can be gathered from these passages, as to his
opinions concerning the nature of the power of which he spoke
thus obscurely. Yet it would be rash to find fault with him on
that account. His language may have been, and in all probability
was, the correct expression of his feelings. His mind was
not of the dogmatic type; and if he does not teach his disci<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165"> 165</span>ples
any very intelligible principles concerning spiritual matters,
it is simply because he is honestly conscious of having
none to teach.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, indications which might be taken to imply
the existence of an esoteric doctrine. "To those," he says,
"whose talents are above mediocrity, the highest subjects may
be announced. To those who are below mediocrity, the highest
subjects may not be announced" (Lun Yu, vi. 19). We are further
told that Tsze-kung said, "the Master's <i>personal</i> displays
<i>of his principles</i>, and <i>ordinary</i> descriptions of them may be
heard. His discourses about <i>man's</i> nature, and the way of
Heaven, cannot be heard" (Ibid., v. 12). This last passage appears
to mean that they were not open to the indiscriminate
multitude, nor perhaps to all of the disciples. But we may reasonably
suppose that the intimate friends who recorded his sayings
were considered by him to be above mediocrity, and were
the depositaries of all he had to tell them on religious matters.</p>

<p>Yet this, little as it was, may not always have been rightly
understood. Once, for example, he says to a disciple, "Sin, my
doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity." This is interpreted
by the disciple (in the Master's absence) to mean only that his
doctrine is "to be true to the principles of our nature, and the
benevolent exercise of them to others" (Ibid., iv. 15). I can
hardly believe that Confucius would have taught so simple a
lesson under so obscure a figure; and it is possible that the
reserve that he habitually practiced with regard to his religious
faith may have prevented a fuller explanation. "The subjects
on which the Master did not talk were—extraordinary things,
feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings" (Lun Yu, vii.
20). And although, in the Doctrine of the Mean (a work which
is perhaps less authentic than the Analects) we find him discoursing
freely on spiritual beings, which, he says, "abundantly
display the powers that belong to them" (Chung Yung, 16),
there are portions of the Analects which confirm the impression
that he did not readily venture into these extra-mundane regions.
Heaven itself, he once pointed out to an over-curious disciple,
preserves an unbroken silence (Lun Yu, xvii. 19). Interrogated
"about serving the spirits of the dead," he gave this striking
answer: "While you are not able to serve men, how can you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166"> 166</span>
serve their spirits?" And when "Ke Loo added, 'I venture to
ask about death?' he was answered, 'While you do not know
life, how can you know about death?'" (Ibid., xi. 11). Another
instance of a similar reticence is presented by his conduct during
an illness. "The Master being very sick, Tsze-Loo asked
leave to pray for him. He said, 'May such a thing be done?'
Tsze-Loo replied, 'It may. In the prayers it is said, Prayer has
been made to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.' The
Master said, 'My praying has been for a long time'" (Ibid.,
vii. 34). I am unable to see "the satisfaction of Confucius with
himself," which Dr. Legge discovers in this reply. To me it
appears simply to indicate the devout attitude of his mind,
which is evinced by many other passages in his conversation.
In short, though we may complain of the indefinite character
of the faith he taught, and wish that he had expressed himself
more fully, there can scarcely be a doubt that Confucius had a
deeply religious mind; and that he looked with awe and reverence
upon that power which he called by the name of "Heaven,"
which controlled the progress of events, and would not suffer
the cause of truth to perish altogether.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that he confined himself chiefly, and indeed
almost entirely, to moral teaching. His main object undoubtedly
was to inculcate upon his friends, and if possible to
introduce among the people at large, those great principles of
ethics which he thought would restore the virtue and well-being
of ancient times. Those principles are aptly summarized in the
following verse: "The duties of universal obligation are five,
and the virtues wherewith they are practiced are three. The
duties are those between sovereign and minister, between father
and son, between husband and wife, between elder brother and
younger, and those belonging to the intercourse of friends.
Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge,
magnanimity, and energy, these three are the virtues universally
binding; and the means by which they carry the duties into
practice is singleness" (Chung Yung, xx. 7). In the Analects,
"Gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness,"
are said to constitute perfect virtue (Lun Yu, xvii. 6).</p>

<p>It is as an earnest and devoted teacher, both by example and
by precept, of these and other virtues, that Confucius must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167"> 167</span>
judged. And in order to assist the formation of such a judgment,
let us take his doctrine of Reciprocity, to which I shall
return in another place. "Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'Is there
one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's
life?' The Master said, 'Is not Reciprocity such a word? What
you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others'" (Lun
Yu, xv. 23). On a kindred topic he thus delivered his opinion:
"Some one said, 'What do you say concerning the principle
that injury should be recompensed with kindness?' The Master
said, 'With what, then, will you recompense kindness?
Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with
kindness'" (Ibid., xiv. 26).</p>

<p>If in the above sentence he may be thought to fall short of
the highest elevation, there are some among his apothegms,
the point and excellence of which have, perhaps, never been
surpassed. Take for instance these:—"The superior man is
catholic and no partizan. The mean man is a partizan and not
catholic." "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought
without learning is perilous" (Ibid., ii. 14, 15). Or these:—"I
will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted
that I do not know men" (Ibid., i. 16). "A scholar, whose mind
is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad
food, is not fit to be discoursed with" (Ibid., iv. 9). "The superior
man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean is adulatory,
but not affable" (Ibid., xiii. 23). "Where the solid qualities
are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity; where the
accomplishments are in excess of the solid qualities, we have
the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid
qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of complete
virtue" (Lun Yu, vi. 16). Lastly, I will quote one which,
with a slight change of terms, might have emanated from the
pen of Thomas Carlyle: "There are three things of which the
superior man stands in awe:—He stands in awe of the ordinances
of heaven; he stands in awe of great men; he stands
in awe of the words of sages. The mean man does not know
the ordinances of heaven, and <i>consequently</i> does not stand in
awe of them. He is disrespectful to great men. He makes sport
of the words of sages" (Ibid., xvi. 8).</p>

<p>These, and various other recorded sayings, go far to explain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168"> 168</span>
if not to justify, the unbounded admiration of his faithful follower,
Tsze-kung: "Our Master cannot be attained to, just in
the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up to by the steps
of a stair. Were our Master in the position of the prince of a
State, or the chief of a family, we should find verified the description
<i>which has been given of a sage's rule</i>:—he would plant
the people, and forthwith they would be established; he would
lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would
make them happy, and forthwith <i>multitudes</i> would resort to <i>his
dominions</i>; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would
be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When
he died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it possible for
him to be attained to?" (Ibid., xix. 25.)</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section II.</span>—<span class="smcap">Laò-tsé.</span><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h4>

<p>Concerning the life of Laò-tsé, the founder of the smallest
of the three sects of China (Confucians, Buddhists, and Taouists),
we have only the most meagre information. Scarcely anything
is known either of his personal character or of his doctrine,
except through his book. His birth-year is unknown to us, and
can only be approximately determined by means of the date
assigned to his famous interview with his great contemporary,
Confucius. This occurred in <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 517, when Laò-tsé was very
old. He may, therefore, have been born about the year <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>
600.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> All we can say of his career is, that he held an office in
the State of Tseheu, that of "writer (or historian) of the archives."
When visited by Confucius, who was the master of a
rival school, he is said to have addressed him in these terms:—"Those
whom you talk about are dead, and their bones are
mouldered to dust; only their words remain. When the superior
man gets his time, he mounts aloft; but when the time is
against him, he moves as if his feet were entangled. I have
heard that a good merchant, though he has rich treasures
deeply stored, appears as if he were poor; and that the superior
man, whose virtue is complete, is yet to outward seeming
stupid. Put away your proud air and many desires; your insin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169"> 169</span>uating
habit and wild will. These are of no advantage to you.
This is all which I have to tell you." After this interview,
Confucius thus expressed his opinion of the older philosopher
to his disciples:—"I know how birds can fly, how fishes can
swim, and how animals can run. But the runner may be
snared, the swimmer may be hooked, and the flyer may be shot
by the arrow. But there is the dragon. I cannot tell how he
mounts on the wind through the clouds and rises to heaven.
To-day I have seen Laò-tsé, and can only compare him to the
dragon" (C. C., vol. i. Proleg. p. 65.—T. T. K., p. liii.—L. T..,
p. iv).</p>

<p>Troubles in the State in which he held office induced him to
retire, and to seek the frontier. Here the officer in command
requested him to write a book, the result of which request was
the Taò-tĕ-Kīng. "No one knows," says the Chinese historian,
"where he died. Laò-tsé was a hidden sage" (T. T. K., p. lvi).</p>

<p>To this very scanty historical information we may add such
indications as Laò-tsé himself has given us of his personality.
One of these is contained in the twentieth chapter of his work,
in which he tells us that while other men are radiant with
pleasure, he is calm, like a child that does not yet smile. He
wavers to and fro, as one who knows not where to turn. Other
men have abundance; he is as it were deprived of all. He is
like a stupid fellow, so confused does he feel. Ordinary men
are enlightened; he is obscure and troubled in mind. Like the
sea he is forgotten, and driven about like one who has no certain
resting-place. All other men are of use; he alone is clownish
like a peasant. He alone is unlike other men, but he honors
the nursing mother (T. T. K., ch. xx).</p>

<p>It is obvious that an estimate so depreciatory is not to be
taken literally. To understand its full significance, it should
be compared to the magnificent description in Plato's Theætetus
of the outward appearance presented by the philosopher, who,
in presence of practical men, is the jest alike of "Thracian
handmaids," and of the "general herd;" who is "unacquainted
with his next-door neighbor;" who is "ignorant of what is
before him, and always at a loss;" and who is so awkward and
useless when called on to perform some menial office, such as
"packing up a bag, or flavoring a sauce, or fawning speech."<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170"> 170</span>
Yet this philosopher, like Laò-tsé, "honors his nursing Mother;"
he moves in a sphere of thought where men of the world cannot
follow him, and where they in their turn are lost (Theætetus,
174-176). Just such a character as that drawn by Plato,
Laò-tsé seems to have been. Living in retirement, and devoted
to philosophy, he appeared to his contemporaries an eccentric
and incompetent person. Yet he says that they called him
great (Ch. lxvii), which seems to imply that his reputation was
already founded in his life-time.</p>

<p>One other reference to himself must not be omitted, for it
evinces the sense he had of the nature of his work in the world.
"My words," so he writes in his paradoxical manner, "are
very easy to understand, very easy to follow,—no one in the
world is able to understand them, no one is able to follow them.
The words have an author, the works have one who enjoins
them; but he is not understood, therefore I am not understood"
(Ch. lxx). On this Stanislas Julien observes, "There is
not a word of Laò-tsé's that has not a solid foundation. In
fact, they have for their origin and basis Tao and Virtue" (L. V.
V. p. 269, n. 2). These expressions, then, suffice to show that
Laò-tsé was not destitute of that sense of inspiration of which
other great prophets have been so profoundly conscious.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section III.</span>—<span class="smcap">Gautama Buddha.</span><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></h4>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span> <i>The Historical Buddha.</i></h5>

<p>Were we to write the history of the Buddha according to
the fashion of Buddhist historians, we should have to begin
our story several ages before his birth. For the theory of his
disciples is, that during many millions of years, through an
almost innumerable series of different lives, he had been preparing
himself for the great office of the savior of humanity
which he at length assumed. Only by the practice of incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171"> 171</span>
self-denial, and unbounded virtue, during all the long line of
human births he was destined to undergo, could he become fitted
for that consummate duty, the performance of which at last
released him forever from the bonds of existence. For the
total extinction of conscious life, not its continuation in a better
sphere, is, or at any rate was, the goal of the pious Buddhist.
And it was the crowning merit of the Buddha, that he not only
sought this reward for himself, but qualified himself by ages
of endurance to enlighten others as to the way in which it
might be earned.</p>

<p>But we will not encumber ourselves with the pre-historic
Buddha, the tales of whose deeds are palpable fictions, but will
endeavor to unravel the thread of genuine fact which probably
runs through the accepted life of Sakyamuni in his final
appearance upon earth. And here we are met with a preliminary
difficulty. That life is not guaranteed by any trustworthy
authority. It cannot be traced back to any known disciple
of Buddha. It cannot be shown to have been written within
a century after his death, and it may have been written later.
Ancient, however, it undoubtedly is. For the separation of
northern from southern Buddhism occurred at an early period
in the history of the Church, probably about two hundred
years after the death of its founder; and this life is the common
property of all sections of Buddhists. It was consequently
current before that separation. But its antiquity does not make
it trustworthy. On the contrary, it is constructed in accordance
with an evident design. Every incident has a definite
dogmatic value, and stands in well-marked dogmatic relations
to the rest. There is nothing natural or spontaneous about
them. Everything has its proper place, and its distinct purpose.
And it is useless to attempt to deal with such a life on
the rationalistic plan of sifting the historical from the fabulous;
the natural and possible from the miraculous and impossible
elements. The close intermixture of the two renders any such
process hopeless. We are, in fact, with regard to the life of
Gautama Buddha, much in the position that we should be in
with regard to the life of Jesus Christ, had we no records to
consult but the apocryphal gospels.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while holding that his biography can never now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172"> 172</span>
be written, it is by no means my intention to imply that it is
impossible to know anything about him. On the contrary, a
picture not wholly imaginary may unquestionably be drawn of
the character and doctrines of the great teacher of the Asiatic
continent. Let us venture on the attempt.</p>

<p>An imposing array of scholars agrees in fixing the date of
his death in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 543, and as he is said to have lived eighty
years, he would thus have been born in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 623. Without entering
now into the grounds of their inference, I venture to
believe that they have thrown him back to a too distant date.
I am more inclined to agree with Köppen, who would place his
death from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 480 to 460, or about two centuries before the
accession of the great Buddhist king Asoka. Westergaard, it is
true, would fix this event much later, namely about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 370. Supposing
the former writer to be correct in his conclusions, the
active portion of the Buddha's life would fall to the earlier
years of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and possibly to the conclusion of
the sixth. His birth, about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 560-540, occurred in a small
kingdom of the north of India, entitled Kapilavastu. Of what
rank his parents may have been, the accounts before us do not
enable us to say. The tradition according to which they were
the king and queen of the country, I regard with Wassiljew as
in all probability an invention intended to shed additional
glory upon him. The boy is said to have been named Siddhartha,
though possibly this also was one of the many titles
bestowed on him by subsequent piety. At an early age he felt—as
so many young men of lofty character have always done—the
hollowness of worldly pleasures, and withdrew himself from
men to lead a solitary and ascetic life. After he had satisfied
the craving for self-torture, and subdued the lusts of the flesh,
he came forth, full of zeal for the redemption of mankind, to
proclaim a new and startling gospel. India was at that time,
as always, dominated by the system of caste. The Buddha,
boldly breaking through the deepest prejudices of his countrymen,
surrounded himself with a society in which caste was
nothing. Let but a man or even a woman (for it is stated that
at his sister's request he admitted women) become his disciple,
agree to renounce the world, and lead the life of an ascetic,
and he or she at once lost either the privileges of a high caste,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173"> 173</span>
or the degradations of a low one. Rank depended henceforth
exclusively upon capacity for the reception of spiritual truth;
and the humblest individual might, by attending to and practicing
the teacher's lessons, rise to the highest places in the
hierarchy. "Since the doctrine which I teach," he is represented
as saying in one of the Canonical Books, "is completely
pure, it makes no distinction between noble and commoner,
between rich and poor. It is, for example, like water, which
washes both noblemen and common people, both rich and poor,
both good and bad, and purifies all without distinction. It
may, to take another illustration, be compared to fire, which
consumes mountains, rocks, and all great and small objects
between heaven and earth without distinction. Again, my doctrine
is like heaven, inasmuch as there is room within it, without
exception, for whomsoever it may be; for men and women,
for boys and girls, for rich and poor" (W. u. T., p. 282). This
was the practical side of Sakyamuni's great reform. Its theoretical
side was this. Life was regarded by Indian devotees,
not as a blessing, but as an unspeakable misery. Deliverance
from existence altogether, not merely transposition to a happier
mode of existence, was the object of their ardent longing. The
Buddha did not seek to oppose this craving for annihilation,
but to satisfy it. He addressed himself to the problem, How is
pain produced, and how can it be extinguished? And his meditations
led him to what are termed "the four truths"—the cardinal
dogma of Buddhism in all its forms. The four truths are
stated as follows:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. The existence of pain.</li>
<li>2. The production of pain.</li>
<li>3. The annihilation of pain.</li>
<li>4. The way to the annihilation of pain.</li>
</ul>


<p>The meaning of the truths is this:—Pain exists; that is, all
living beings are subject to it; its production is the result of
the existence of such beings; its annihilation is possible; and
lastly, the way to attain that annihilation is to enter on the
paths opened to mankind by Gautama Buddha. In other
words, the way to avoid that awful series of succeeding births
to which the Indian believed himself subject, was to adopt the
monastic life; to practice all virtues, more especially charity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174"> 174</span>
to acquire a profound knowledge of spiritual truths; and, in
fine, to follow the teaching of the Buddha. Renounce the
world, and you will—sooner or later, according to your degree
of merit—be freed from the curse of existence; this seems to
sum up, in brief, the gospel proclaimed with all the fervor of a
great discovery by the new teacher. After about forty-five years
of public life devoted to mankind, he died at the age of eighty,
at Kusinagara, deeply mourned by a few faithful disciples who
had clustered around him, and no doubt regretted by many who
had found repose and comfort in his doctrines, and had been
strengthened by his example. The names of his principal disciples
become almost as familiar to a reader of Buddhist books
as those of Peter, James, and John, to a Christian. Maudgalyâyana
and Sariputtra, the eminent evangelists, and Ananda, the
beloved disciple, the close friend and servant of the Buddha,
are among the most prominent of this little group. With them
rested propagation of the faith, and the vast results, which in
two centuries followed their exertions, prove that they were not
remiss. The stories of the thousands who embraced the proffered
salvation in the life-time of the Buddha are pious fancies.
It was the apostles and Fathers of the Church who, while
developing his doctrines and largely adding to their complexity
and number, almost succeeded in rendering his religion the
dominant creed of India.</p>

<p>Such is, in my opinion, the sum total of our positive knowledge
with regard to the life lived, and the truths taught, by
this great figure in human history. The two points to which I
have adverted—namely, the formation of a society apart from
the world in which caste was nothing, and the hope held out
of annihilation by the practice of virtues and asceticism—are
too fundamental and too ancient to be derived from any but
the founder. After all, ecclesiastical biographers, while they
adorn their heroes with fictitious trappings, do not invent them
altogether. A man from whose tuition great results have
flowed, cannot be a small man; something of those results
must needs be due to the impulse he has given. And if the
Buddha must have taught something, must have inaugurated
some reform, what is he more likely to have taught, than the
way to the annihilation of pain? what reform more likely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175"> 175</span>
have inaugurated than the creation of a society held together
by purely spiritual ties? Both are absolutely essential to Buddhism
as we know it. Both are closely connected. For Buddhism
would have had nothing to offer without the hope of extinction;
and this hope, while leading to the practice of an austere and
religious life, can itself be fulfilled only by that life; implying
as it does a detachment from the bonds of carnality which hold
us to this scene of suffering. Thus, these corner-stones of
Buddhism—flowing as they must have done from a master-mind—may,
with the highest probability, be assigned to its
author.</p>

<p>On one other point there is no reason to call in question the
testimony of the legend. We need not doubt he really was the
pure, gentle, benevolent, and blameless man which that legend
depicts him to have been. Even his enemies have not attempted
(I believe) to malign his character. He stands before us as one
of the few great leaders of humanity who seem endowed with
every virtue, and free from every fault.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span> <i>The Mythical Buddha.</i></h5>

<p>Buddhistic authorities divide the life of their founder into
twelve great periods, under which it will be convenient to treat
of it:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. His descent from heaven.</li>
<li>2. His incarnation.</li>
<li>3. His birth.</li>
<li>4. His display of various accomplishments.</li>
<li>5. His marriage, and enjoyment of domestic life.</li>
<li>6. His departure from home, and assumption of the monastic character.</li>
<li>7. His penances.</li>
<li>8. His triumph over the devil.</li>
<li>9. His attainment of the Buddhaship.</li>
<li>10. His turning the Wheel of the Law.</li>
<li>11. His death.</li>
<li>12. His cremation, and the division of his relics.</li>
</ul>


<p>1. Following, then, the guidance of the accepted legend, we
must begin with his resolution to be born on earth for the salvation
of the world. After thousands of preparatory births, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176"> 176</span>
was residing in a certain heaven called Tushita, that being one
of the numerous stages in the ascending series of the abodes of
the blessed. At length, the end of his sojourn in this heaven
arrived. He determined to quit the gods who were his companions
there, and to be born on earth. Careful consideration convinced
him that the monarch Suddhodana, and his queen, Maya
Devi, alone possessed these preëminent qualifications which
entitled them to become the parents of a Buddha. Suddhodana
lived in the town of Kapila, and belonged to the royal family of
the Sakyas, the only family which the Bodhisattva (or destined
Buddha) had discovered by his examination to be free from
faults by which it would have been disqualified to receive him
as one of its members. His wife, in addition to the most consummate
beauty, was distinguished for every conjugal and feminine
virtue. Here, then, was a couple worthy of the honor
about to be conferred upon their house.</p>

<p>2. At this critical moment Maya had demanded, and obtained,
the permission of the king to devote herself for a season to the
practice of fasting and penance. While engaged in these austerities,
she dreamt that a beautiful white elephant approached
her, penetrated her side, and entered her womb. At this very
time, Bodhisattva actually descended in the shape of a white
elephant, and took up his abode within her body. On waking,
she related the dream to her husband, who called upon the
official Brahmins to interpret it. They declared it to be of good
augury. The queen, they said, carried in her womb a being
who would either be a "Wheel King," or Sovereign of the
whole world; or if he took to a monastic career, would become
a Buddha. All things went well during Maya's pregnancy.
According to all accounts she underwent none of the discomforts
incidental to that state. One writer states that "her soul
enjoyed a perfect calm, the sweetest happiness; fatigue and
weariness never affected her unimpaired health." Another
remarks that she enjoyed "the most perfect health, and was
free from fainting fits." An additional gratification lay in the
fact, that she was able to see the infant Bodhisattva sitting
calmly in his place within her person.</p>

<p>3. Ten months having passed (a Buddha always takes ten),
the queen expressed a desire to walk in a beautiful garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177"> 177</span>
called Lumbini; and, with the king's ready permission, proceeded
thither with her attendants. In this garden the hour
of her delivery came on. Standing under a tree (the <i>ficus religiosa</i>),
which courteously lowered its branches that she might
hold on by them during labor, she gave birth to the child who
was afterwards to be the first of humankind. Gods from heaven
received him when born, and he himself at once took several
steps forward, and exclaimed: "This is my last birth—there
shall be to me no other state of existence: I am the greatest
of all beings." Ananda, his cousin, and afterwards his disciple,
was born at the same moment. Maya, notwithstanding her
excellent health, died seven days after her child's birth. This
was not from any physical infirmity, but because it is the invariable
rule that the mother of a Buddha should die at that
exact time. The reason of this, according to the Lalitavistara,
is, that when the Buddha became a wandering monk her heart
would break. Other respectable authorities assert, that the
womb in which a Bodhisattva has lain is like a sanctuary where
a relic is enshrined. "No human being can again occupy it,
or use it" (P. A., No. III. p. 27). Maya was born again in one
of the celestial regions, and the infant was confided to her sister,
his aunt Prajapati, or Gautami, who was assisted in the
care of her charge by thirty-two nurses. He was christened
Sarvarthasiddha, usually shortened into Siddhartha. He is also
known as Gautama Buddha, by which name he is distinguished
from other Buddhas: as Sakyamuni, the hermit of the Sakya
race; as the Tathâgata, he who walks in the footsteps of his
predecessors; as Bhagavat, Lord; and by other honorific titles.</p>

<p>Soon after the birth of the Bodhisattva, he was visited and
adored by a very eminent Rishi, or hermit, known as Asita (or
Kapiladevila), who predicted his future greatness, but wept at
the thought that he himself was too old to see the day when
the law of salvation would be taught by the infant whom he
had come to contemplate.</p>

<p>4. When the appropriate age for the marriage of the young
prince arrived, a wife, possessing all the perfections requisite
for so excellent a husband, was sought. She was found in a
maiden named Gopa (or Yasodhara), the daughter of Dandapani,
one of the Sakya race. An unexpected obstacle, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178"> 178</span>
arose. The father of the lovely Gopa complained that Siddhartha's
education had been grossly neglected, and that he was
wanting alike in literary accomplishments and in muscular proficiency—things
which were invariably demanded of the husbands
of Sakya princesses. It does, indeed, appear that Suddhodana
had taken little pains to cultivate his son's abilities,
and that he had mainly confined himself to the care of his personal
safety by surrounding him with attendants. Accordingly,
he asked the prince whether he thought he could exhibit his
skill in those branches of knowledge, the mastery of which
Dandapani had declared to be a necessary condition of his consent.
Siddhartha assured his father that he could; and in a
regular competitive examination, which was thereupon held, he
completely defeated the other princes, not only in writing,
arithmetic, and such matters, but in wrestling and archery. In
the last art, especially, he gained a signal victory, by easily
wielding a bow which none of the others could manage.</p>

<p>5. Gopa was now won, and conducted by her husband to a
magnificent palace, where, surrounded by a vast harem of beautiful
women, he spent, some years of his life in the enjoyment
of excessive luxury. But worldly pleasure was not to retain him
long in its embrace.</p>

<p>6. A crisis in his life was now approaching. Suddhodana had
been warned that Siddhartha would assume the ascetic character
if four objects were to meet his sight; an old man, a sick
man, a corpse, and a recluse. Suddhodana, who would have
much preferred his son being a universal monarch to his becoming
a Buddha, anxiously endeavored to guard him from
coming across these things. But all was in vain. One day,
when driving in the town, he perceived a wrinkled, decrepit,
and miserable old man. Having inquired of the coachman what
this strange creature was, and having learnt from him that he
was only suffering the general fate of humanity, the Bodhisattva
was much affected; and, full of sad thoughts, ordered his chariot
to be turned homewards. Meeting on two other occasions,
likewise when driving, with a man emaciated by sickness, and
with a corpse, he was led to still further reflections on the
wretchedness of the conditions under which we live. Prepared
by these meditations, he yielded completely to the tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179"> 179</span>
aroused within him when, on a fourth excursion, he came across
a monk. The aspect of this man—his calmness, his dignity,
his downcast eyes, his decent deportment—filled him with desire
to abandon the world like him.</p>

<p>The die was cast. Nothing could now retain the Bodhisattva,
at this time a young man of nine-and-twenty, from the course
that approved itself to his conscience. In vain did his father
cause his palace to be surrounded with guards. In vain did the
ladies of the harem (acting under instructions) deploy their most
ravishing arts to captivate and to amuse him. His resolution
was finally fixed by a singular circumstance. The beautiful
damsels who ministered to him had sought to engage his attention
by an exhibition of the most graceful dancing, accompanied
by music, displaying their forms before his eyes as they
executed their varied movements. But the Bodhisattva, deep
in his meditations, was wholly unaffected. He fell asleep; and
the women, baffled in their attempts and wearied out, soon followed
his example. But in the course of the night the prince
awoke. And then the sight of these girls, slumbering in all
sorts of ungainly and ungraceful postures, utterly disgusted
him. Summoning a courtier, named Chandaka, he ordered him
at once to prepare his favorite horse Kantaka, that he might
quit the city of his fathers, and lead the life of a humble recluse.
But before thus abandoning his home, there was one
painful parting to be gone through. One tie still held him to
the world. His wife had just become a mother. Anxious to see
his infant son, Rahula, before his departure, he gently opened
the door of his wife's apartment. He found her sleeping with
one hand over the head of the child. He would fain have taken
a last look at his little boy, but fearing that if he withdrew the
mother's hand she would awake and hinder his departure, he
retired without approaching the bed. In the dead of night,
mounted on Kantaka, and with the one attendant whom he had
taken into the secret, he managed to leave Kapilavastu unperceived,
never to return to it again till he had attained the full
dignity of a Buddha.</p>

<p>7. Having sent back Chandaka with the horse, the Bodhisattva
commenced, alone and unaided, a course of austerities
fitted to prepare him for his great duty. He tried Brahminical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180"> 180</span>
teachers, but was soon dissatisfied with their doctrine. Five of
the disciples of one of these teachers followed him for six years
in the homeless and wandering life he now began. He adopted
the most rigid asceticism, reducing his body to the last degree
of feebleness and emaciation. But this too discovered itself to
his mind as an error. He took to eating again, and regained
his strength, whereupon the five disciples left him, viewing him
as a man who had weakly abandoned his principles.</p>

<p>8. After this period of gradual approach to the required perfection
the Bodhisattva went to Bodhimanda, the place appointed
for his reception of the Buddhaship. Here he had to
withstand a furious attack by the demon Mara, who first endeavored
to annihilate him by his armies, and then to seduce
him by the fascination of his three daughters. But Gautama
withstood his male and female adversaries with equal calmness
and success. Of the latter he had possibly had enough in his
princely palace.</p>

<p>9. All these trials having been surmounted, he placed himself
under the Bodhi (or Intelligence) tree, and there, engaging in
the most intense meditations, gradually reached the intellectual
and moral height towards which he had long been climbing.
He was now in possession of Bodhi, or that complete and perfect
knowledge which constitutes a Buddha. He was thus fit
to teach the law of salvation, but the Lalitavistra represents
him as still doubting for a moment whether he should engage
in a task which he feared would be thankless and unavailing.
Men, he thought, would be incapable of receiving so sublime a
doctrine, and he would incur fatigue and make exertions in
vain. Silence and solitude recommended themselves at this
moment to his spirit. But from a resolution so disastrous he
was turned aside by the intercession of the god Brahma.</p>

<p>10. He proceeded accordingly to "turn the Wheel of the
Law," or to preach to others, during the forty-five remaining
years of his long life, the truths he had arrived at himself.
The current lives speak, in their exaggerated manner, of his
magnificent receptions by the kings whose countries he visited,
and of the thousands of converts whom he made by his preaching,
or who, in technical language, obtained Nirvâna through
him. His father and other members of his family were among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181"> 181</span>
his followers. But among the first-fruits of his teaching were
the five Brahmins who had abandoned him when he had
relaxed in his ascetic habits. These, on first perceiving him,
spoke of him with contempt as a glutton and a luxurious fellow
spoilt by softness. But his personal presence filled them with
admiration, and they at once acknowledged his perfect wisdom.
During this time the two orders of monks and nuns, with their
strict regulations enforcing continence and temperance, were
founded. Gautama's aunt and nurse, Prajapati, was the first
abbess; the Buddha, who had intended to exclude women from
his order, having consented to admit them at her request.
Rahula, his son, received the tonsure.</p>

<p>11. After he had firmly established his law in the hearts of
many devoted disciples, the Buddha "entered Nirvâna" at the
age of eighty, at Kusinagara. That his death was deeply
mourned by the friends who had hung upon his lips, and drawn
their knowledge of religious truth from him, need not be related.</p>

<p>12. A pompous account is given of his funeral rites, of which
it will be sufficient to mention here that his body was laid upon
a pyre, and burnt after the manner of burning in use for
Chakravartins, or Universal Monarchs. The princes of Kusinagara
wished to keep his relics to themselves; but seven kings,
each of whom demanded a share, made threatening demonstrations
against them, and after some quarrelling it was agreed to
distribute the relics among the whole number. They were
therefore divided into eight portions, the royal family of each
country taking one. A dagoba, or monument, was erected over
them in each of the capitals governed by these royal Buddhists.</p>

<p>Of the numerous stories that are told with regard to the
effects of the Buddha's preaching, of the amazing miracles he
is said to have performed, and of the wonders reported to have
happened at his death and his cremation, there will be an
opportunity of speaking in another place. For the present, it
is enough to relate the legend of his life in its main features,
according to the version piously believed by the millions of human
beings who—in China, Tartary, Mongolia, Siam, Burmah,
Thibet, and Ceylon—look to him as their law-giver and their
savior.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section IV.</span>—<span class="smcap">Zarathustra.</span><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h4>

<p>Slaves, condemned to make bricks without straw, would
hardly have a more hopeless task than he who attempts to
construct, from the materials now before him, a life of Zarathustra.
Eminent as we know this great prophet to have been,
the details of his biography have been lost forever. His name
and his doctrines, with a few scattered hints in the Gâthâs, are
all that remain on record concerning the personality of a man
who was the teacher of one great branch of the Aryan race,
and whose religion, proclaimed many centuries, possibly even a
thousand years, before Christ taught in Galilee, was a great and
powerful faith in the days when Marathon was fought, and is
not even now extinct. We will gather from these fragmentary
sources what knowledge we can of the Iranian prophet, but we
will refuse to fill up the void created by the absence of historical
documents with ingenious hypotheses or subtle speculations.</p>

<p>Something approaching to a bit of biography is to be found
in the opening verses of the fifth Gâthâ, which are to this
effect:—</p>

<p>"It is reported that Zarathustra Spitama possessed the best
good; for Ahura Mazda granted him all that may be obtained
by means of a sincere worship, forever, all that promotes the
good life, and he gives the same to all those who keep the
words and perform the actions enjoined by the good religion.</p>

<p>"Thus may Kava Vistaspa, Zarathustra's companion, and the
most holy Frashaostra, who prepare the right paths for the
faith which He who Liveth gave unto the priests of fire, faithfully
honor and adore Mazda according to his (Zarathustra's)
mind, with his words and his works!</p>

<p>"Pourutschista, the Hetchataspadin, the most holy one, the
most distinguished of the daughters of Zarathustra, formed the
doctrine, as a reflection of the good mind, the true and wise
one."<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183"> 183</span></p>

<p>Here we find an allusion to the interesting fact that the Zarathustra
had a daughter who contributed to the formation of
the Parsee creed. The phrase, most distinguished of the daughters,
probably does not mean that the prophet was the father
of several daughters, but merely that this one was celebrated
as his coadjutor. Spiegel has in vain endeavored to discover the
name of this lady's husband, but it seems to be doubtful whether
anything is known of her matrimonial relations. The fact which
it concerns us to notice is, that already in these primitive ages
we have a female saint appearing on the scene. In addition to
St. Pourutschista, mention is made of two disciples, who were
evidently leaders in the apostolic band. The evangelic ardor of
Frashaostra is touched upon in the preceding Gâthâ, where it
is stated that "he wished to visit my Highlands (<i>i. e.</i>, Bactria)
to propagate there the good religion," and Ahura Mazda is implored
to bless his undertaking. Rava Vistaspa is celebrated
in the same place as having obtained knowledge which the
living Wise One himself had discovered (Yaspa li. 16, 17. Parsees,
p. 161). The names of both are well known, being frequently
mentioned in the Gâthâs. They appear to have been
intimate associates of the prophet. Thus a supposed inquiry is
addressed to Zarathustra, "Who is thy true friend in the great
work? who will publicly proclaim it?" and the answer is,
"Kava Vistaspa is the man who will do this" (Yasna, xlvi. 14).
And Frashaostra is spoken of as having received from God, in
company with the speaker (probably the prophet himself), "the
distinguished creation of truth" (Ibid., xlix. 8). It is added,
"for all time we will be thy messengers," or in other words,
Evangelists.</p>

<p>Not only do we obtain from the Gâthâs a glimpse of Zarathustra
attended by zealous disciples, eager to proclaim the
good tidings he brought: we learn something also of the opposition
he encountered from the adherents of the older faith.
And since he actually names himself in the course of one of
these compositions, which bears every appearance of genuineness
and antiquity, we need not doubt the authenticity of the
picture therein given of his relations to these opponents. They
were the adherents of the old Devas, the gods whom Zarathustra
dethroned;—polytheists, averse to this unheard-of introduc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184"> 184</span>tion
of monotheism into their midst. And they formed, at least
during a part of the prophet's life-time possibly during the
whole of it, by far the stronger party, for he refers to them in
these terms:—</p>

<p>"To what country shall I go? where shall I take refuge?
what country gives shelter to the master (Zarathustra) and his
companion? None of the servants pay reverence to me, nor do
the wicked rulers of the country. How shall I worship thee
further, living Wise One?</p>

<p>"I know that I am helpless. Look at me being amongst few
men, for I have few men (I have lost my followers or they have
left me); I implore thee weeping, thou living God who grantest
happiness as a friend gives <i>a present</i> to his friend. The good of
the good mind is in thy own possession, thou True One!...</p>

<p>"The sway is given into the hands of the priests and prophets
of idols, who, by their <i>atrocious</i> actions, endeavor to destroy the
life of man....</p>

<p>"To him who makes this very life increase by means of
truth to the utmost for me, who am Zarathustra myself, to such
an one the first (earthly) and the other (spiritual) life will be
granted as a reward together with all good things to be had on
the imperishable earth. Thou, living Wise One, art the very
owner of all these things to the greatest extent; thou, who art
my friend, O Wise One!" (Yasna. xlv. 1, 2, 11, 19.)</p>

<p>And elsewhere we come across this exclamation: "What help
did Zarathustra receive, when he proclaimed the truths? What
did he obtain through the good mind?" (Ibid., xlix. 12.)</p>

<p>And the piteous question is put to Ahura Mazda: "Why has
the truthful one so few adherents, while all the mighty, who
are unbelievers, follow the Liar in great numbers?" (Ibid.,
xlvii. 4.)</p>

<p>These simple and natural verses point to a prophet who was—for
a time at least—without honor in his own country.
Whereas the later representations of his career depict him as
the triumphant revealer of a new faith, before whose words of
power the "Devas," or god of polytheism, flee in terror and
dismay, we meet with him here in the character of a persecuted
and lonely man, unsupported by the authorities of his
nation, opposed by a powerful majority, and imploring, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185"> 185</span>
distress and desolation of his mind, the all-powerful assistance
of his God. Such is the reality; how widely it differs from the
fiction we have already seen. But as is always the case with
great prophets, who are rejected in their own days and honored
after their death, the reality is forgotten; the fiction is universally
accepted.</p>

<p>Little need be said of the doctrines taught by Zarathustra.
His main principle is belief in the one great God, Ahura Mazda,
whom he substitutes for the many gods of the ancient Aryans.
He was in fact the author of a monotheistic reformation. The
worshipers of these deities are often referred to in opprobrious
terms, more especially as "liars," or "adherents of lies," while
the devotees of Ahura are spoken of as the good, or as those
who are in possession of the truth. It is only through the spirit
of lying that the godless seek to do harm; through the true
and wise God they cannot do it (Yasna, xlvii. 4). This God, the
friend of the prophet, is honored in language of deep and simple
adoration; not with the mere vapid epithets of praise which
become common in the later sections of the Zend-Avesta. Zarathustra
feels himself entirely under his protection, and describes
himself ready to preach whatever truths this great Spirit
may instruct him to declare.</p>

<p>Beyond this great central dogma—which he announces with
all the fervor of a discoverer—there is nothing of a very distinctive
kind in his theology. The doctrine of a separate evil
spirit opposed to Ahura Mazda does not hold in the Gâthâs that
place which it afterwards obtained in the sacred literature of
the Parsee. Dr. Haug considers that Zarathustra held merely
a philosophical dualism, the two principles of existence—bad
and good—being united in the supreme nature of the ultimate
Deity. From this great and all-wise Being every good thing
emanates. He is the inspirer of his prophet; the teacher of
his people; the counselor in the many perplexing questions
that harass the minds of his worshipers. To him the pious souls
resort in trouble; by him both earthly possessions and spiritual
life are granted to those who rightly seek him. Ahura
Mazda is the true God; and there is no other God but Ahura
Mazda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186"> 186</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section V.</span>—<span class="smcap">Mahomet.</span><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h4>

<p>The last man who has obtained the rank of a prophet is
Mohammed, or Mahomet, the son of Abdallah and Amina.
Since his time none has succeeded in founding a great, and at
the same time an independent religion. Many have wrought
changes in preëxisting materials; but no one has built from the
foundation upwards. The religion of Mahomet, though compounded
of heathen, Judaic, and Christian elements, is not a
mere reformation of any of the faiths in which these constituents
were found. It depends for its original sanction upon none
of these, but derives its <i>raison d'etre</i> exclusively from the direct
inspiration of its author.</p>

<p>This prophet was born at Mecca in 571, and was the posthumous
child of Abdallah, by his wife Amina. His mother died
when he was six years old, and he was then taken charge of
by his grandfather Abd-al-Mottalib, who, dying in two years,
left the child to the care of his son Abu Talib. Mahomet was
poor, and had to work for his living in a very humble occupation.
In process of time, however, he obtained a comfortable
employment in the service of a rich widow, named Khadija,
who was engaged in business, and whom he served in the capacity
of a commercial traveler; or at first perhaps in a lower
situation. His mercenary relation to her was soon superseded
by a tenderer bond. He married her in 595, she being then
thirty-eight or thirty-nine years of age, and fifteen years older
than himself. She was evidently a woman of strong character,
and retained an unbroken hold upon the affection of Mahomet
until her death in 619. He subsequently married many wives,
of whom Ayisha was the most intimate with him; but none of
them appears to have exercised so much influence upon his
character as Khadija.</p>

<p>She it was who was the first to believe in the divine inspiration
which her husband began to disclose in the year 612, at
the mature age of forty; and she it was who encouraged and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187"> 187</span>
comforted the rising prophet during his early years of trouble
and persecution. His first revelation was received by him in
612. It purported to be dictated by the angel Gabriel, who was
Mahomet's authority for the whole of the Koran.</p>

<p>"Recite thou," thus spoke his heavenly instructor, "in the
name of thy Lord who created;—created man from clots of
blood:—Recite thou! For thy Lord is the most beneficent, who
hath taught the use of the pen;—hath taught man that which
he knoweth not" (K., p. 1.—Sura xcvi).</p>

<p>After this first reception of the word of God, Mahomet passed
through that period of extreme depression and gloom which
appears to be the universal lot of thoughtful characters, and
which Mr. Carlyle has designated "the Everlasting No." For
many months he received no more revelations, and in his despondency
he entertained a wish to throw himself down from
high mountains, but was prevented by the appearance of
the angel Gabriel. In time another communication came to
strengthen him in his work; and revelations now began to pour
down abundantly. His earliest disciples, besides his wife and
his daughters, were his cousin Ali, and the slave Zayd, whom
he had adopted as a son. By and by he obtained other important
converts, among whom were Abu Bakr, Zobayr, and Othman,
afterwards the Chalif.</p>

<p>His earliest revelations were inoffensive to the Meccans; and
it was only when he began to preach distinctly the unity of
God, the resurrection, and responsibility to the Deity, that opposition
was aroused. Persecution followed upon disapproval.
Some of Mahomet's followers were compelled to take refuge in
Abyssinia, and he himself told the Meccans instructive legends
of nations whom God had destroyed for their wickedness in
rejecting the prophets who had been sent to them. In 616,
however, Mahomet was guilty of a relapse, for he published a
revelation recognizing three Meccan idols, Lat, Ozza, and Manah,
as intercessors with Allah. In consequence of this concession
to their faith, the Korayschites—his own tribe—fell down on
their faces in adoration of Allah, and the exiles in Abyssinia
returned to their native land. But the prophet was soon
ashamed of the weakness by which he had purchased public
support. The verse was struck out of the Koran, and the pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188"> 188</span>ing
recognition of idolatry attributed to the suggestion of the
devil. Tradition assigns to this occasion the following verses:</p>

<p>"We have not sent any apostle or prophet before thee,
among whose desires Satan injected not some wrong desire;
but God shall bring to nought that which Satan had suggested.
Thus shall God affirm his revelations, for God is Knowing-Wise!
That he may make that which Satan hath injected, a
trial to those in whose hearts is a disease, and whose hearts are
hardened" (K. p. 593—Sura xxii. 51, 52).</p>

<p>After his renewed profession of Monotheism, Mahomet and
his followers were naturally subjected to renewed persecutions.
Conversions, however, did not cease; and that of Omar, in 617,
was of great importance to the nascent community. Yet matters
were at last pushed to extremities by the unbelievers.
Mahomet's family, the Haschimites, were excluded from all
commercial and social intercourse by the other Korayschites,
and compelled to withdraw into their own quarter. This state
of quarantine probably lasted from the autumn of 617 to that of
619. At its conclusion Mahomet lost his wife Khadija, and his
uncle Abu Talib, who had given him protection.</p>

<p>He was now exposed to many insults and much annoyance.
The insecurity in which he lived at Mecca forced him to seek
supporters elsewhere. Now the Caaba or holy stone at Mecca
was the scene of an annual pilgrimage from the surrounding
country. Mahomet made use of the advent of the pilgrims in
621 to enlist in his cause six inhabitants of Medina, who are
reported to have bound themselves to him by the following
vow:—Not to consider any one equal to Allah; not to steal;
not to be unchaste; not to kill their children; not willfully to
calumniate; to obey the prophet's orders in equitable matters.
Paradise was to be the guerdon of the strict observance of this
vow, which from the place where it was taken was called the
first Akaba. In the following year, 622, Mahomet met seventy-two
men of Medina by night at the same ravine, and the oath
now taken was the second Akaba. The believers swore to
receive the prophet and to expend their property and their
blood in his defense. Twelve of the seventy-two disciples were
selected as elders, the prophet following therein the example of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189"> 189</span></p>

<p>A place of refuge from the hostility of their countrymen was
now open to the rising sect. All the Moslems who were able
and willing gradually found their way to Medina. At length
none of the intending emigrants remained at Mecca but the
prophet himself and his two friends Abu Bakr, and Ali. The
designs of the Korayschites against Mahomet's life failed, and
he effected his escape to a cave at some little distance from
Mecca, and in the opposite direction from Medina. Here he
remained in concealment with Abu Bakr for three days, the
daughter of the latter bringing food for both. After this time
a guide brought three camels with which they proceeded in
safety to Medina. The prophet reached Koba, a village just
outside it, on the 14th of September 622. He remained here
three days, and received the visits of his adherents in Medina
every day. This was the celebrated Hegira, or flight, from
which the Mussulman era is dated.</p>

<p>In the course of a year, the majority of the inhabitants of
Medina had adopted Islam, and a little later those who remained
heathens were either compelled or persuaded to embrace, or at
least to submit to, the new creed and its apostle. The Jews
alone retained their ancient religion. But while Mahomet was
thus successful with Medina, he was still exposed to the bitter
hostility of Mecca. War between the two cities was the result
of the hospitality accorded to him by the former. Mahomet,
who now united in his person the temporal and spiritual
supremacy in his adopted home, did not shrink from the contest,
but carried it on with vigor and success. In the year 624,
having gone in pursuit of a Meccan caravan, he met the army
of the Korayschites at Badr, and defeated them; although he
had not much more than three hundred men, while they commanded
from nine hundred to one thousand. In the following
year indeed the Moslems were defeated in the battle of Ohod;
but in 627 the siege of Medina, undertaken by Abu Sofyân at the
head of ten thousand men, was raised after three weeks without
serious loss on either side.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enmity of its inhabitants, Mecca still
retained in the eyes of Mahomet and his disciples its ancient
prerogative of sanctity. The Kibla, or point towards which the
Moslem was to turn in prayer, had for a time been Jerusalem;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190"> 190</span>
but Mahomet had restored this privilege to his native town two
years after the Hegira. There too was the sacred stone, no less
venerated by the pious worshiper of Allah than by the adherents
of Lat, Ozza and Manah; and thither it was that the
religious pilgrimage had to be performed, for Mahomet had no
intention of giving up this part of his ancestral faith. He was
desirous in the spring of 628 of performing the pilgrimage to
Mecca. The Koreish, however, came out to meet him with an
army, determined to preclude his entrance to the city. The
design was therefore abandoned; but an important treaty was
concluded between Mahomet and Sohayl, who acted as envoy
from Mecca. By this compact both parties agreed to abstain
from all hostilities for ten years; Mahomet was to surrender
fugitives from Mecca, but the Meccans were not to surrender
fugitives from him; no robbery was to be practiced; it was
open to any one to make an alliance with either party;
Mahomet and his followers were to be permitted to enter Mecca
for three days in the following year for the festival. After making
this agreement Mahomet, yielding to circumstances, performed
the ceremonies of the festival at Hodaybiya near Mecca
and then withdrew.</p>

<p>The treaty caused great dissatisfaction among the Moslems,
as well it might; and the humiliation was heightened when the
prophet, shortly after making it, was compelled to fulfil its
provisions by giving up certain proselytes who had fled to him,
from Mecca. Nevertheless his power continued to grow, and a
tribe residing near Mecca took advantage of the treaty to conclude
an alliance with him.</p>

<p>Mahomet now began to place himself on a level with crowned
heads. In 628 he had a seal made with the inscription upon it:
"Mahomet the messenger of God." Furnished with this official
seal, he despatched six messengers with letters to the Emperor
Heraclius; to the King of Abyssinia; to the Shah of Persia; to
Mokawkas, lord of Alexandria; to Harith the Ghassanite chief;
and to Hawda in Yamama, a province of Arabia. The purport
of all these missives was an exhortation to the various sovereigns
and chiefs to embrace the new religion, and a promise
that God would reward them if they did, with a warning that
they would bear the guilt of their subjects if they did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191"> 191</span></p>

<p>In the same year Mahomet besieged the town of Chaybar,
whose inhabitants were Jews. Many of them were killed; the
rest were permitted to withdraw with their families. Kinana,
their chief, was executed; and his wife Cafyya was added to the
already numerous harem of the victor.</p>

<p>The following year, 629, witnessed the performance by the
Moslems of the pilgrimage to Mecca for the first time since the
Hegira. The prophet summoned those who had accompanied
him to Hodaybiya the year before to go with him now. The
Koreish, according to the stipulations of the treaty, left the
city; the Moslems entered it, performed their devotions, and
retired after three days. This year was also marked by a signal
victory over a Ghassanite chief, who had executed a Mussulman
envoy.</p>

<p>In January, 630, taking advantage of the invitation of an
allied tribe who had quarreled with Mecca, Mahomet quitted
Medina with a large army for the purpose of taking that city.
The exploit was facilitated by the desertion of the general of
the Koreish, Abu Sofyân, who privately escaped to the Moslem
camp and made his confession of faith. Next day the forces of
the prophet entered Mecca with scarcely any resistance. In the
following year he laid down the terms upon which the conquered
city was to be dealt with. Abu Bakr, accompanied by 300
Moslems, was sent to Mecca as leader of the pilgrims. Ali was
charged to make the proclamation to the people which is found
in the 9th Sura of the Koran.</p>

<p>"An Immunity from God and his Apostle to those with
whom ye are in league, among the Polytheist Arabs! (those who
join gods with God). Go ye, therefore, at large in the land four
months: but know that God ye shall not weaken; and that
those who believe not, God will put to shame—And a proclamation
on the part of God and his Apostle to the people on the
day of the greater pilgrimage, that God is free from any engagement
with the votaries of other gods with God as is his Apostle!
If therefore ye turn to God it will be better for you; but
if ye turn back then know that ye shall not weaken God: and
to those who believe not, announce thou a grievous punishment.
But this concerneth not those Polytheists with whom ye are in
league, and who shall have afterwards in no way have failed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192"> 192</span>
you, nor aided any one against you. Observe, therefore, engagement
with them through the whole time of their treaty: for
God loveth those who fear him. And when the sacred months
are passed, kill those who join other gods with God wherever
ye shall find them; and seize them, besiege them, and lay wait
for them with every kind of ambush: but if they shall convert,
and observe prayer, and pay the obligatory alms, then let them
go their way, for God is gracious, merciful. If any one of those
who join gods with God ask an asylum of thee, grant him an
asylum, that he may hear the Word of God, and then let him
reach his place of safety. This, for that they are people devoid
of knowledge" (K., p. 611.—Sura ix. 1-6).</p>

<p>Without quoting the proclamation at full length, we may observe
that in substance the terms granted were these. Those
of the heathen with whom treaties had been made were informed
that they should be free for four months. These are the
"sacred months" alluded to in the text, and which had always
been observed as a time of truce by the heathen Arabs, but
which Mahomet deprived of their privilege. After this period
was past the Moslems might kill the heathens or take them
prisoners wherever they might find them. With other heathens,
with whom there was no treaty in existence, Allah announced
that he would have nothing further to do. Moreover, the heathen
were excluded by this proclamation from approaching the holy
places of Mecca in future. "O believers!"—such are the words
of this last decree—"only they who join gods with God are
unclean! Let them not, therefore, after this year, come near
the sacred Temple" (K., p. 615.—Sura ix. 28).</p>

<p>The prophet was now at the climax of his power. All Arabia
was his; both materially and spiritually subdued beneath his
authority. The city of his birth, which had spurned him as
one of her humble citizens, was now compelled to receive him
as her lord. No triumph could be more complete; and it is a
rare, if not a unique, example of a new religion being persecuted,
imperilled, well-nigh crushed, rescued, strengthened,
contending for supremacy, and supreme, within the life-time of
its founder. But that life-time was now approaching its end.
Mahomet in 632 celebrated the last festival he was destined to
witness with the utmost pomp. He went with all his wives to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193"> 193</span>
Mecca, and thousands of believers assembled around him there.
He preached to them from his camel. He sacrificed one hundred
camels. On the 8th of June, 632, he expired in the hut of
Ayischa of a remittent fever from which he had been suffering
a short time.</p>

<p>The character of the prophet Mahomet is an open question.
Between the glowing admiration bestowed upon him by Carlyle,
and the sneering depreciation of Sprenger, there lie numerous
intermediate possibilities of opinion. His sincerity, his
veracity, his humanity, his originality, are all topics of discussion
admitting of varied treatment. The old and simple method
of treating Mahomet as an impostor scarcely merits notice.
Among serious students of his life it may be pronounced extinct.
But between positive imposture and a degree of truthfulness
equal to that which all would concede to Confucius, or
to Jesus, there are many degrees, and a man may be more or
less sincere in many particulars which do not involve the fundamental
honesty of his conduct. It is in such particulars that
the character of Mahomet is most open to suspicion. Few, I
believe, would be able to read the earlier Meccan Suras, instinct
as they are with a spirit of glowing devotion to a new idea,
without entire conviction of the sincerity of their author. Nor
can we reasonably doubt that he himself fully believed in the
inspiration he professed to receive. The Koran is written precisely
in that loose, rambling, and irregular style, which would
indicate that its author was above the laws of human composition.
If (as is said by some) there is beauty in the original
Arabic, that beauty entirely evaporates in translation. The
man whose work it is gave utterance to the thoughts of the
moment as they were borne in upon him, in his opinion by an
external power. But while he no doubt conceived himself as
the instrument of the divine being, it is also exceedingly probable
that in his later life he abused the weapon which he had
thus got into his possession. That is to say, instead of waiting
patiently for the revelation, and allowing Allah to take his own
time, he in all likelihood put forth as revealed whatever happened
to suit the political purpose of the day, and that at whatever
moment was convenient to himself. In other words, he
may have become less of a passive, and more of an active agent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194"> 194</span>
in the composition of the Koran. Take, for example, the two following
Suras, belonging to his earliest period, as specimens of
the inspired poetic style:—"Say: O ye unbelievers! I worship
not that which ye worship, and ye do not worship that which I
worship; I shall never worship that which ye worship, neither
will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your religion;
to me my religion." "Say: He is God alone: God the eternal!
He begetteth not, and is not begotten; and there is none like
unto him" (K., pp. 12, 13.—Suras cix., cxii).</p>

<p>Contrast these fervent exclamations with such a passage as
this, from one of the latest Suras:—</p>

<p>"This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have
filled up the measure of my favors upon you: and it is my
pleasure that Islam be your religion; but whoso without willful
leanings to wrong shall be forced by hunger to transgress, to
him, verily, will God be indulgent, merciful. They will ask thee
what is made lawful for them. Say: Those things which are
good are legalized to you, and the prey of beasts of chase which
ye have trained like dogs, teaching them as God hath taught
you. Eat, therefore, of what they shall catch for you, and
make mention of the name of God over it, and fear God:
Verily, swift is God to reckon: This day, things healthful are
legalized to you, and the meats of those who have received the
Scriptures are allowed to you, as your meats are to them. And
you are permitted to marry virtuous women of those who have
received the Scriptures before you, when you shall have provided
them their portions, living chastely with them without
fornication, and without taking concubines" (K., p. 632.—Sura
v. 5-7).</p>

<p>The doctrine of direct inspiration, applied to matters like
these, is almost a mockery. Yet Mahomet may have continued
to think that God assisted him in the task of laying down laws
for the believers, and we cannot accuse him of positive insincerity,
even though his revelations were no longer the spontaneous
outpourings of an overflowing heart.</p>

<p>A more difficult question is raised when we inquire how much
of his teaching was borrowed from others, and whether there
was any one who acted as his prompter in the novel doctrines
he announced. Now there is evidence enough, some of it sup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195"> 195</span>plied
by the Koran itself, that Mahomet was preceded by a sect
called Hanyfites, who rejected the idolatry of their countrymen
and held monotheistic doctrines. He spoke of himself as
belonging to this sect, of which the patriarch Abraham was
considered the representative and founder. Abraham is referred
to in the Koran with the epithet "Hanyf," and as one of those
who do not join gods with God (<i>E.g.</i>, Sura iii. 89; vi. 162; xvi.
121). A dozen or so of the contemporaries of the prophet
renounced idolatry before him, and were Hanyfites. Three of
these became Christians, and a fourth, by name Zayd, professed
to be neither Jew nor Christian, but to follow the religion of
Abraham. Zayd was acknowledged as his forerunner by
Mahomet himself. But besides these sources of conversion
which lay open to the prophet, it is plain from the Koran itself
that he had had much intercourse with a person (or persons) of
the Jewish faith. Mahomet was not a scholar, and his continual
allusions to events in Jewish history plainly indicate a personal
source. Moreover, the narratives are given in that somewhat
perverted form which we should expect to find if they
were derived from loose conversation rather than from study.
His belief in the unity of God is not therefore a peculiarity
which cannot be explained by reference to the circumstances in
which his youth was passed. What was original with him was
not the doctrine so much as the intensity with which it took
possession of his mind, and the fervor which allowed him no
rest until he had done his best to impart to others the profound
conviction he entertained of this great truth.</p>

<p>Mahomet in fact began his public career as a simple preacher.
The resistance he met with at home, and the necessity of relying
for self-preservation on the swords of the men of Medina,
converted him from a prophet to a potentate. The change was
not one which he could avoid without sacrificing all chances of
success; but it does appear to have exercised an unfortunate
influence upon his character. As the governor of Medina he
became tyrannical and even cruel. Among the worst features of
his life is his conduct to the Jews after his attempts at conciliation
had been shown to be fruitless. For instance, a Jewish
tribe, the Banu Kaynoka, with whom a treaty of friendship had
been concluded, were expelled from Medina. Another tribe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196"> 196</span>
the same religion, the Banu Nadhyr, were blockaded in their
quarter, and driven to capitulate, on condition of being allowed
to leave Medina with their movable property. On the very day
upon which the siege by Abu Sofyân in 627 came to an end,
Mahomet blockaded the Banu Koraytza, also Jews, and compelled
them to surrender at discretion. All the men, six hundred
in number, were put to death, and the women were sold
as slaves; a punishment which, even on the supposition that
the tribe was hostile to the prophet, was unpardonably severe.
In the ensuing year he marched against Chaybar, a town
inhabited by Jews, besieged and took it. All the Jews taken in
arms were put to death, whereupon the rest surrendered on
condition of being permitted to withdraw with their families
and their portable goods, exclusive of weapons and the precious
metals. Kinana, their leader, was executed, and it is a
suspicious circumstance that Mahomet married his widow Cafyya.
Nor were these the worst of the prophet's misdeeds. He
even stooped to sanction, if not to order, private assassination.
Shortly after his victory at Badr, a woman and an old man,
both of whom had rendered themselves offensive by their anti-Mussulman
verses, were murdered in the night; and in both
instances the murderers received the protection and countenance
of the prophet and his followers.</p>

<p>Unbridled authority had in fact corrupted him. All those
who did not adhere to his cause committed in his eyes the
crime of opposing the will of God. To a man empowered
by a special commission like his, the ordinary restraints of
morality could not apply. Hence also, if he required a larger
number of wives than was permitted to any other Moslem, a
special revelation was produced to justify the excess. This was
one of the weakest points in the prophet's character. Instead
of setting an example to the community, he was driven to justify
his self-indulgence by means which were nothing short of
a perversion of religion to his own ends. There would have
been nothing reprehensible, considering his age and country,
in his indulgence in polygamy, had he observed any kind of
moderation as to its extent. Where he happened to take a
fancy to a woman, and that woman did not object to him, the
moral sense of his countrymen would not have revolted by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197"> 197</span>
taking her to wife. But it was revolted by the unrestricted
freedom with which he added wife to wife, and concubine to
concubine; a freedom so great as to degenerate into mere
debauchery. He married women whom he had never seen, and
who were sometimes already married. Mere beauty seems to
have justified in his own eyes the addition of a new member
to his harem, and there could be no pretence of real affection
in the case of the women whom, without previous acquaintance,
he took to his matrimonial bed. Exclusive of Khadija, the
total number of his wives was thirteen, of whom nine survived
him. He had also three concubines.</p>

<p>That his procedure scandalized the faithful is shown by the
necessity he felt of defending it by the pliant instrument of
revelation. Not only did he obtain from God a special law
entitling him to exceed the usual number of wives; other peculiarities
in his conduct were justified, either by an <i>ex post facto</i>
decision applicable to all, or by an appeal to his extraordinary
rights in his character of prophet. He had, for example
conceived a desire to possess Zaynab, the wife of his adopted
son Zayd. Zayd obligingly divorced her, and received the greatest
favor from the prophet for this friendly conduct. Zaynab
made it a condition of her compliance that the union with
Mahomet should be sanctioned by revelation, and this sanction
was of course procured. Marriage with an adopted son's wife
was somewhat shocking, and the following reference in the
Koran indicates the manner in which the affair was regarded:</p>

<p>"And, remember, when thou saidst to him unto whom God
had shown favor [<i>i. e.</i>, to Zayd], and to whom thou also hadst
shown favor, 'Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God;' and
thou didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light,
and didst fear man; but more right had it been to fear God.
And when Zayd had settled concerning her to divorce her, we
married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in the faithful
to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they have settled
the affair concerning them. And the behest of God is to
be performed. No blame attacheth to the prophet where God
hath given him a permission" (K., p. 566.—Sura xxxiii. 38,39).</p>

<p>In another case he wished to induce a cousin, who was
already married, though only to a heathen husband living at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198"> 198</span>
Mecca, to become his wife; but she, believer as she was, refused
to be untrue to her conjugal duties. He permitted himself also
to accept the love of women who simply surrendered themselves
to him without the sanction of their relations, conduct which
placed them in a highly disadvantageous position, since in case
of dismissal by her husband, a woman thus informally married
was not entitled to the dowry which other married women would
receive, nor could she claim the protection of her family.
"Among the heathen Arabs," observes Sprenger, "a man who
accepted such a favor would have been killed by the woman's
family" (L. L. M., vol. iii. p. 84). But for the case of the
cousin and for the case of such obliging female devotees the
Koran had its suitable provisions:—</p>

<p>"O Prophet! we allow thee thy wives whom thou hast dowered,
and the slaves whom thy right hand possesseth out of the
booty which God hath granted thee, and the daughters of thy
uncle, and of thy paternal and maternal aunts who fled with
thee <i>to Medina</i>, and any believing woman who hath given herself
up to the prophet, if the prophet desired to wed her—a privilege
for thee above the rest of the faithful.... Thou mayest decline
for the present whom thou wilt of them, and thou mayest
take to thy <i>bed</i> whom thou wilt, and whomsoever thou shalt long
for of those thou shalt have before neglected; and this shall not
be a crime in thee. Thus will it be easier to give them the desire
of their eyes, and not to put them to grief, and to satisfy them
with what thou shalt accord to each of them. God knoweth
what is in your hearts, and God is knowing, gracious."</p>

<p>By a combination of qualities which is not uncommon, he
added to an unrestricted license in his own favor an equally
unrestricted jealousy concerning others. He could not bear the
thought that any other man might possibly enjoy one of his
wives even after his death. His followers were told that they
"must not trouble the Apostle of God, nor marry his wives
after him, for ever. This would be a grave offense with God."
In the same paltry spirit he orders them, when they would ask
a gift of any of his wives, to ask it from behind a veil. "Purer
will this be for your hearts and for their hearts." Lest any
stranger should trouble this uneasy husband by obtaining a
sight of his wives' naked faces, he required them invariably to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199"> 199</span>
wear a veil in public, and never to expose themselves unveiled
except to near male relations, slaves, or women (K., p. 569.—Sura
xxxiii. 51, 53, 55).</p>

<p>Texts like these exhibit the degeneracy of the prophet's
character in his later days. He wanted the stimulus of adversity
to keep him pure. But he had done his work, and that
work was on the whole a good one. Not indeed that there was
anything very original or striking in the doctrines he announced.
The Koran rings the changes on the unity of God, his power,
his mercy, and his other well-known qualities; on the resurrection,
with its delights for the faithful and its terrible judgments
for the wicked; and on the vast importance of belief in the
prophet and submission to his decrees. But this religion, though
containing no elements that did not already exist in its two
parents, Judaism and Christianity, was an improvement on the
promiscuous idolatry which it superseded. It was less sensual
and more abstract; and its moral tone was higher. Greater still
than the improvement in the creed of the Arabs was the improvement
in their material <i>status</i>. Unity of faith brought with
it unity of action. From a number of scattered, independent,
and often hostile tribes, the Arabs became a powerful and conquering
nation. Other peoples were in course of time converted,
and the religion of Mahomet was in the succeeding centuries
carried in triumph over vast districts where the name of Christ
had hitherto reigned supreme. Districts of heathen Africa have
also accepted it. Were the prophet able to speak to us now,
he would be entitled to say that the manifest blessing of Allah
had rested upon the work he had begun in obscurity and persisted
in through persecution; and that the partiality of heaven
was evident from the fact that Christianity had never succeeded,
and had no prospect of succeeding, in regaining the vast territory
in Europe and in Africa from which Islam has expelled it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section VI.</span>—<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ.</span></h4>

<p>When we endeavor to write the life of Jesus Christ, the
greatest of the prophets, we are beset by peculiar difficulties
arising from the nature of the materials. While in the case of
the Buddha we receive from authorities a life which, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200"> 200</span>
largely composed of fiction, is at least uniform and consistent,
in the case of Jesus we have biographies from several sources,
all of them partly historical, partly legendary, and each in some
respects at issue with all the rest. Hence the labor of sifting
fact from fiction, as also that of reproducing and classifying the
fictitious element itself, is far more difficult. In sifting fact
from fiction we have to judge, among two, three, or four versions
of an occurrence, which is likely to be the most faithful
statement of the truth, and within this statement itself how
much we may accept, how much we must reject. And in reproducing
and classifying the fictitious element we have not
merely to relate a simple story, but to combine into our narrative
varying, and sometimes conflicting, forms of the same
fundamental myth.</p>

<p>Hence further subdivision will be needed in the case of Jesus
than was requisite in treating the lives of any of the other
prophets. We may in fact discern in the gospels three distinct
strata: a stratum of fact; a stratum of miracle and marvel;
and a stratum (in John) of mere imagination <i>within</i> the realm
of natural events. Correspondently to these divisions in the
sources we will treat Jesus first as historical; secondly, as
mythical; thirdly, as ideal. The historical Jesus is the actual
human figure who remains after abstraction has been made of
the miraculous and legendary portions of his biography. The
mythical Jesus, who is found in the three first gospels, is the
human subject of legendary narratives; the ideal Jesus, who is
found in John, is a completely superhuman conception.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be needful to remark that the names affixed
to the several gospels are merely traditional, and that in using
them as a brief designation for these works, no theory as to
their actual authorship is intended to be implied. The gospels
(excepting perhaps the fourth) were the work of many authors,
though ultimately compiled and edited by a single hand. Who
this editor was is of little moment; and who the original authors
were we never can discover. So that the gospels are to all intents
and purposes anonymous; but it will be convenient, after
noting this fact, to continue to describe them by their current
titles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201"> 201</span></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span>—<i>The Historical Jesus.</i></h5>

<p>In attempting to sketch the outline of the actual life of
Jesus—and anything more than an outline must needs be
highly conjectural—there are some general principles which it
is advisable to follow. Recollecting that we have to deal with
biographers who have mingled in promiscuous confusion the
supernatural with the natural, impossibilities with probabilities,
fables with facts, it becomes our duty to endeavor to separate
these heterogeneous elements according to some consistent plan.
That this can ever be perfectly accomplished is not to be expected.
The figure of Jesus must ever move in twilight, but we
may succeed in reducing the degree of unavoidable obscurity.</p>

<p>The first of the maxims to be observed will be furnished by
a little consideration of the kind of thing likely to be the earliest
committed to writing, as also to be the most accurately
handed down by tradition. This, it appears to me, would be
sayings, rather than doings. Nothing in the life of Jesus is
more characteristic and remarkable than his oral instruction;
this would impress itself deeply upon the minds of his hearers,
and nothing, we may fairly conjecture, would be so soon committed
to writing either by them or by their followers. Moreover,
the records of discourses and parables would be, in the
main, more accurate than those of events; slight differences in
the words attributed to a speaker being (except in special cases)
less material than divergences in the manner of portraying his
actions. Historical confirmation of this hypothesis is not wanting.
There is the well-known statement of Papias that Matthew
wrote down the "sayings" of Christ in Hebrew [Syro-Chaldaic].
And if we look for internal evidence, we find it in the far
greater agreement among the synoptical gospels as to the doctrines
taught by Jesus than as to the incidents of his career.
The incidents bear traces of embellishment undergone in passing
from mouth to mouth from which the doctrines are free.
In some cases, moreover, there is concurrence as to the doctrines
taught along with divergence as to the place where, and the
circumstances under which, they were delivered. Added to
which considerations there is the all-important fact that the
events in the life of Christ are often of a supernatural order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202"> 202</span>
while his discourses (excepting those in John) present nothing
irreconcilable with his position in regard either to his epoch,
his presumable education, or his nationality.</p>

<p>Giving this preference to sayings in general, over doings in
general, we may next establish an order of preference among
doings themselves. Of these, some are natural and probable;
others unnatural and improbable; others again supernatural
and impossible. The first kind will, of course, be accepted
rather than the second; while the third kind must be rejected
altogether. And as a corollary from this general principle, it
follows that where one narrative gives a simpler version than
another of the same event or series of events, the simpler version
is to be preferred.</p>

<p>A third rule of the utmost importance is that when any
statement is opposed, either directly or by its implications, to
subsequent tradition, that statement may be confidently received.
For when the whole course of opinion in the Christian
Church has run in a given direction, the preservation in one of
our Gospels of an alleged or implied fact conflicting with the
established view, is an unmistakable indication that the truth
has been rescued from destruction in a case where succeeding
generations would gladly have suppressed it.</p>

<p>A fourth maxim, which is likely to be useful, is that wherever
we can perceive traces of faults or blemishes in the character
of Christ, we may presume them to have actually existed. For
his biographers were deeply interested in making him appear
perfect, and they would have been anxious wherever possible to
conceal his weaknesses. Where, therefore, they suffer such
human frailties to be perceived, their unconscious testimony is
entitled to great weight. For although they themselves either
do not see or do not acknowledge that what they record is really
evidence of faultiness at all, yet it is plain that circumstances
conveying such an impression to impartial minds are not likely
to have been invented. The conduct ascribed to Jesus might be
capable of justification from his peculiar mission or his peculiar
conception of his duties, but admiring disciples would not wantonly
burden him with a load not rightly his. Yet this principle,
though unquestionable in the main, must be tempered with
the qualification that there are cases where his followers may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203"> 203</span>
have misunderstood and misrepresented him. It must be added
that a similar presumption of truth attaches to the record of
faults or blunders in the conduct of the disciples, whose characters
their disciples were likewise anxious to exalt.</p>

<p>In the fifth place, it is a reasonable supposition that the less
complete the outline of the life of Jesus contained in any Gospel,
the more authentic is that Gospel. Gaps in the story told
by one writer which, in another writer, have been filled up, are
strong indications of actual gaps in the life as known to the
first Christians. While it is true that the compiler of one Gospel
might, from ignorance or from design, omit some historical
fact which the compiler of another would insert, yet it is unlikely
that whole years would be passed over in silence, or remarkable
events left out, where any genuine knowledge of those
years or those events was possessed by the biographer. But
nothing is more natural than that a space, subsequently felt to
be a serious and almost intolerable void, should in process of
time be removed by the exercise of the imagination craving to
fill the empty canvas with living figures. Nor even where there
is no positive blank, is it surprising that many actions conformable
to the notion formed of Christ should be fitted into his
career, and made to take their places alongside of others of a
more unquestionable nature. We shall therefore prefer the
scantiest account of the life of Jesus to the fullest.</p>

<p>A careful comparison of the first three Gospels—which alone
can pretend to an historical character—will establish the fact
that the second, ascribed to Mark, is the most trustworthy, or
to speak accurately, the least untrustworthy, according to these
canons. For in the first place, it absolutely omits many of the
most noteworthy events comprehended by the other Gospels in
the life of Jesus. Secondly, it sometimes gives a natural version
of a circumstance which appears in the others as supernatural;
or a comparatively simple version of a circumstance which the
others have converted into something mystical. It surpasses
the others in statements, and still more in omissions, implying
divergence from well-established subsequent tradition; and in
general the far greater scantiness of detail, the failure to fill up
blanks as the other Evangelists have done, the almost fragmentary
character of this Gospel, are points telling largely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204"> 204</span>
its favor. That, however, we have the earliest, or anything
approaching the earliest form of the life of Jesus in Mark
it would be a great error to assume. As much as Mark
differs from Matthew and Luke, so much at least did the
primitive story differ from his, and in the same direction.
Nay, it must have differed far more, for by the time the
second Gospel was committed to its present form, a cloud
of marvels had already surrounded the person of Jesus, and
obscured his genuine figure. Through the mist of this cloud
we must endeavor to discern such of his lineaments as have not
been totally and forever hidden from our scrutinizing gaze.</p>

<p>Very little is known of the parents of Jesus, and even that
little has rather to be inferred from casual references than
gathered from direct statements. Joseph, his father, was a carpenter
or builder, but his status is nowhere clearly defined.
He and his family appear, however, to have been well known
in their native country, and he was probably, therefore, not a
mere workman, but a tradesman in comfortable circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
At any rate, he was the father of a considerable family, consisting
of five sons and of more than one daughter (Mt. xiii. 55,
and xii. 46; Mk. vi. 3, and iii. 31; Lu. viii. 19). The names of
the brothers of Jesus,—James, Joses, Simon, and Judas,—have
been preserved, while those of his sisters are unknown.</p>

<p>Whether there is not some confusion here, may indeed be
doubted, for we hear also of another Mary, the mother of
James and Joses (Mk. xv. 40; Mt. xxvii. 56), and it is possible
(as M. Renan supposes), that the names of her children have
been substituted for those of the genuine brothers of Christ
which had been forgotten. Paul certainly mentions James,
the Lord's brother (Gal. i. 19), and it would be natural to interpret
this literally. But the question does not admit of any positive
decision. Of the actual existence, however, of both brothers
and sisters there can be no reasonable doubt; for they are spoken
of as personages who were familiar to their neighbors, while the
very fact that they play no part in the subsequent history is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205"> 205</span>
guarantee that they have not been invented for a purpose. Little
is known of his mother Mary, her genuine form having been
transfigured at a very early period by the Christian legend. The
first and third Gospels have made her the subject of a story which
would force us—if we accept it at all—to consider Jesus as her
illegitimate child, born of some other father than Joseph. But
there is no adequate ground to ascribe to her such laxity of
conduct. For aught we can discern to the contrary, she seems
to have borne a fair reputation among her countrymen, who
undoubtedly, according to the incidental and therefore unbiased
testimony of all four Evangelists, believed Jesus to have been
the son of Joseph, begotten, like the rest of his family, in wedlock
(Mt. xiii. 55; Mk. vi. 3; Lu. iv. 22; Jo. vi. 42.)</p>

<p>Beyond the fact that Joseph and Mary occupied a respectable
position in Nazareth, we can say little of them. The lineage
of both was plainly unknown to the compilers of the Gospels,
since Joseph has been endowed with two different fathers,
while the parentage of Mary has not even been alluded to. All
that we can venture to assert is, that neither of them were
reputed to be of the family of David, for Jesus took pains to
prove that the Messiah need not, as was commonly believed, be
descended from that monarch (Mt. xxii. 41-46; Mk. xii. 35-37;
Lu. xx. 41-44). There would have been no occasion for his
ingenious suggestion that David, by calling the Messiah Lord,
disproved the theory that this Lord must be his son, unless he
had felt that his belonging to a family which could not claim
such a pedigree might be used as an argument against his
Messianic character. We may confidently conclude then that
his lineage was obscure.</p>

<p>That his birth took place at Nazareth is abundantly obvious
from the very contrivances resorted to in Matthew and Luke to
take his parents to Bethlehem for that event. According to
either of these narratives one fact is plain: that the habitual
dwelling-place of the family was Nazareth; while Matthew has
preserved the valuable information that he was called a Nazarene
(Mt. ii. 23), a statement which is confirmed by the manner
in which he is alluded to in John, as "Jesus of Nazareth, the
son of Joseph" (Jo. i. 45). Jesus therefore passed in his life-time
for a native of Nazareth, and as it does not appear that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206"> 206</span>
he ever contradicted the current assumption, as moreover the
only two authorities which are at issue with this assumption
are also at issue with one another on all but the bare fact of
the birth at Bethlehem, we need not hesitate to draw the inference
that he was born at Nazareth.</p>

<p>In his youth the son of Joseph was apprenticed to his father's
trade, and he may have practiced it for many years before
he took to his more special vocation of a public teacher. He
was at any rate known to his neighbors as "the carpenter,"
and his abandonment of that calling for one in which he seemed
to pretend to a position of authority over others, caused both
astonishment and indignation among his old acquaintances.</p>

<p>His public career was closely preceded by that of an illustrious
prophet, by whom he must have been profoundly influenced—John
the Baptist. Very little of the doctrine of John has
been preserved to us, his fame having been eclipsed by that of
his successor. But that little is sufficient to evince the great
similarity between his teaching and that of Jesus. He was in
the habit of baptizing those who resorted to him in the Jordan,
and of inculcating repentance, because the kingdom of heaven
was at hand (Mt. iii. 2). Now precisely the same tone was
adopted by Jesus after the captivity of John. Repentance was
inculcated on account of the approaching advent of the kingdom
of heaven, and a mode of instruction similar to that of
John was practiced. Both these prophets, affected no doubt by
the troubled condition of Judea, enjoined the simple amendment
of the lives of individuals as the means towards a happier
state of things. Both attracted crowds around them by
the force and novelty of their preaching. Jesus, according to a
probable interpretation of the narrative, was so much impressed
by the lessons of his predecessor, and by the baptism received
from him, that he for a time retired to a solitary place, living
an ascetic life, and pondering the stirring questions that must
have burnt within him. During this retirement Jesus could
mature his designs for the future, and on emerging from it he
was able at once to take up the thread of John the Baptist's
discourses. Possibly John himself had perceived the high
capacity of the young Nazarene, and had appointed him to the
prophetic office. But the story of his baptism by John has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207"> 207</span>
unfortunately so surrounded with mythical circumstances, that
the true relations between these teachers can no longer be discerned.</p>

<p>Meditating in the wilderness on the words of John the Baptist,
and on the state of his country, the notion may have
entered the mind of Jesus that he himself was the destined
Messiah. While the power he felt within him may have given
birth to the idea, the idea once born would react upon his
nature and increase the power within him. But whether the
conception of his own Messiahship arose now or at some other
period, it is plain that he was animated by it during his public
career, and that it gave to all his teaching its peculiar tone of
independent authority. How far he was completely convinced
of his own claim to the Messianic title will be considered in
another place; it is sufficient to say here that he was plainly
anxious that this claim should be acknowledged, and the rights
it conferred upon him recognized.</p>

<p>On emerging from his retreat, he began the public promulgation
of his doctrines; at first, however, with caution and reserve,
and keeping within the lines marked out by John the
Baptist. Attracted by the young enthusiast, a select band of followers
gathered around him, and while he inspired them with
implicit trust, they no doubt inspired him in their turn with
higher confidence. The reticence which modesty or hesitation
had produced gradually melted away, and he began boldly to
put forth pretensions which, while they repelled and scandalized
many, drew others into a closer companionship and a more implicit
submission. Simon and Andrew, James and John, were
the first, or among the first, of his disciples. Eight others
joined him at about the same period of his life, their names
being Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son
of Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Canaanite, and Judas (Mk.
iii. 14-19; Mt. x. 1-4). While these formed the inner circle, we
must suppose that he had many other admirers and followers,
who were either less intimate with him, or less constant in
their attendance. And there may even have been others of
equal intimacy with the twelve apostles, whose names have not
been handed down to us. For all the apostles did not enjoy an
equally close and unreserved friendship with their master.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208"> 208</span>
Three of their number—Simon, James, and John—stood towards
him in an altogether special and peculiar relationship.
They are far more prominent than any of the other nine. They
were selected to accompany Jesus when others were left behind.
They formed an inmost circle within the circle of his more constant
companions. Them alone he is said to have distinguished
by names of his own invention. On Simon he conferred the
name of Peter. To James and John, the sons of Zebedee, he
applied the familiar nickname of Boanerges, or sons of thunder,
which seems to indicate that they were distinguished by
the fervor of their zeal (Mk. iii. 16, 17).</p>

<p>The admirers of Jesus were scarcely, if at all, less numerous
among the female than among the male sex. Indeed, he seems
to have exercised a very marked fascination over women. When
he went to Jerusalem, he was followed by many women from
Galilee, who had been accustomed to contribute to his wants,
and to give him that personal attention which kindly women
know so well how to confer. Mary Magdalene whom he had
healed of some mental ailment, Mary the mother of James,
Salome the mother of the sons of thunder, were among the
most devoted of these, while two sisters, Mary and Martha,
Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, are
also mentioned (Mk. xv. 40, 41; Lu. viii. 2, 3, x. 38, 39). If we
may believe one of the Evangelists, who stands alone in this
respect, the homage of women was particularly agreeable to
Jesus, who received it with words of the highest praise (Lu. vii.
36-50, x. 38-42). That some among these many female followers
were drawn to him by the sentiment of love is, at least, highly
probable. Whether Jesus entertained any such feeling towards
one of them it is impossible to guess, for the human side of his
nature has been carefully suppressed in the extant legend.</p>

<p>Supported then by adherents of both sexes, Jesus entered
upon his career of a public teacher. His own house was at
Capernaum (Mt. iv. 13), but he wandered from place to place in
the exercise of his vocation, staying, no doubt, with friends
and disciples. It is not necessary to follow him in these peregrinations,
of which only the vaguest accounts have been preserved
by the Evangelists. But two remarkable circumstances
deserve to be noted; namely, that his own family rejected his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209"> 209</span>
pretensions, and that he met with no success in his own district.
Of the former, in addition to the negative evidence furnished
by the fact that neither Mary nor the brothers of Jesus
are mentioned among the believers, we have the positive evidence
of John that his brothers did not believe (Jo. vii. 5), confirmed
by the statement in the other Gospels that his family
attempted to see him during the earlier part of his career, and
that Jesus positively refused to have anything to do with them
(Mk. iii. 31-35; Mt. xii. 46-50; Lu. viii. 19-21). This desire on
the part of the family to confer with him, and the manner in
which Jesus, disavowing all special ties, adopts all who "do the
will of God" as mother, brother and sister, admits of but one
construction. Mary and her other children were anxious to
draw him away from the rash and foolish mode of life—as they
deemed it—on which he had entered, and Jesus, understanding
their design, avoided an unpleasant interview by simply declining
to be troubled with them. And if, as is highly probable, it
was they who thought him mad (Mk. iii. 21), we have further proof
that neither his mother nor any of the other members of his
family can be counted among his converts, at any rate during
his life-time. The second circumstance, his complete failure in
his own neighborhood, is attested by a saying of his own, recorded
by all four Evangelists. A prophet, he is reported to
have said, is without honor in his own country, among his own
kin, and in his own house (Mk. vi. 4). To which it was added
that he was unable to perform any work of power there, beyond
curing a few sick people. And these cures evidently did not
impress the skeptical Nazarenes, for we are told that "he marveled
because of their unbelief" (Mk. vi. 5, 6).</p>

<p>Leaving, therefore, these hard-hearted neighbors, he proceeded
to address the people of Galilee and Judea in discourses
which excited great attention; sometimes inculcating moral
truths in plain but eloquent language, sometimes preferring to
illustrate them by little stories, the application of which he
either made himself or left to his hearers to discover. Had
these stood alone, they would have sufficed to give him a high
reputation. But he did not depend on words alone for his success
among the people. The peculiar condition of Palestine at
this epoch gave him a favorable opportunity of supplementing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210"> 210</span>
words by deeds. The trials and sufferings they had undergone,
both from the Herodian family and the Romans; the constant
outrage to their deepest feelings afforded by the presence of an
alien soldiery; the insults, humiliations, and cruelties they
endured at the hands of their conquerors, had wrought the people
up to a state of almost unbearable tension and extreme
excitement. That under the pressure of such a state of things
nervous disorders should be widely prevalent, is not to be wondered
at. And these affections, as is well known, are peculiarly
infectious, easily spreading through a whole village and raging
in a whole country (See, for example, Hæcker's Epidemics,
<i>passim</i>). Hysteria, moreover, takes many forms. Now it may
show itself as species of madness; now as the imagination of
some positive disease. Here it may be violent and outrageous;
there morbid and gloomy. Another peculiarity is its tendency
to increase the more, the greater the attention paid to it by
friends and onlookers. To be an object of interest to those
around is enough to inflame the symptoms of the hysterical
patient. And when this interest took shape in a belief that he
was inhabited by some bad spirit—which was equally the theory
of the Jews in the time of Christ, and of Christians up to
the middle ages—it was natural that the evil should be magnified
to the highest degree. There are, however, some individuals
who exercise a peculiar power over sufferers of this description.
Their looks, their touch, their words, are all soothing.
By addressing the victims of hysteria in tones of authority, by
taking their hands, or otherwise endeavoring to calm their
excited nerves, these physicians of nature may put a stop to the
pain, or expel the illusion. In modern days they would be
called mesmerists, and though the peculiarities of temperament
to which they owe their mesmeric faculty are not yet understood,
their influence is well known to those who have examined
into the subject.</p>

<p>Among the Jews, the subjects of these current maladies were
said to be possessed by devils. And it was a common profession
to cast out these so-called devils,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> for we are told that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211"> 211</span>
practiced by the adherents of the Pharisees. What means
they employed we do not know. Probably they were not of the
mesmeric order, but consisted in charms and exorcisms which,
being believed by the patients to have the power of curing
them, actually had it. At any rate, the fact remains that Jesus
and the Pharisees are reputed to have possessed a similar influence
over the demons, and if we accept the statement as true in
the one case we cannot consistently reject it in the other. It
remains to be considered, however, whether the evidence is
such as to induce us to believe it in either. Now it is quite
true that a great many absurd and impossible miracles are
ascribed to Jesus in the Gospels. But considering the important
place occupied in his life—as it has come down to us—by
his cures of sick people; considering the possibility above suggested
that many of these might have taken place by known
methods; considering too the extremely easy field which Palestine
presented for their application, it would appear more
likely that there might be a basis of truth in the numerous
accounts of sudden recoveries effected by him, than that they
were all mere inventions. We may then assume, without here
entering into details, that a number of unfortunate people,
thought to be possessed by devils, either met him on his way,
or were brought to him by relations, and were restored to
health by the authoritative command addressed to the evil
spirit to depart; mingled with the sympathetic tone and manner
towards the tormented subject of possession. Individual
examples of these apparently miraculous cures may be open to
doubt from the very inaccurate character of the records, and
for this reason it will be better for the present to admit the
general fact without binding ourselves to this or that special
instance of its occurrence.</p>

<p>Possessing this power himself, and ignorant of its source,
Jesus attempted to communicate it to his disciples. It is expressly
stated that he gave them power to heal sicknesses and
cast out devils (Mk. iii. 15), though it is doubtful whether they
met with much success in this vocation. On one occasion, at
least, a signal failure is reported, and as the fact stated redounds
neither to the glory of Christ, who had appointed his disciples
to the work, nor of the disciples who had received the appoint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212"> 212</span>ment,
we may believe it to be true (Mk. ix. 14-29). A parent
had brought his little son to the apostles to be delivered from
some kind of fits from which he suffered. The apostles could
do nothing with him. When Jesus arrived he ordered the spirit
to depart, and the boy, after a violent attack, was left tranquil.
We are not told indeed how long his calmness lasted, nor
whether the fits were permanently arrested. For the moment,
however, a remedy was effected, and the disciples naturally inquired
why they had not been equally successful. The extreme
vagueness of the reply of Jesus renders it probable that his
remedial influence was due to some personal characteristic
which he could not impart to others. This conclusion is confirmed
by the noteworthy fact that an unknown person exercised
the art of casting out devils in the name of Jesus, though not
one of his company (Mk. ix. 38-40). Here the name would be
valuable only because of its celebrity, the expulsion of the devils
being due, as in the case of Jesus himself, to the personal endowments
of the exorcist. At any rate, we have the broad facts
that the Pharisees, Jesus himself, and the unknown employer
of his name, were all proficient in the art of delivering patients
from the supposed possession of evil spirits. Possibly too the
apostles did the same, and it was certainly the intention of Jesus
that they should.</p>

<p>Such exhibitions of power, though they might tend to
strengthen the influence of Jesus among the multitude, were
not the principal means on which he depended for acceptance.
His sermons and his parables were both more remarkable and
more original. In addition to the fact that he taught, in the
main, pure and beautiful moral doctrines, he well knew how to
exemplify his meaning by telling illustrations. The parables
by which he enforced his views have become familiar to us all,
and deserve to remain among our most precious literary possessions.
What more especially distinguished his mode of teaching
from that of other masters was the air of spiritual supremacy
he assumed, and his total independence of all predecessors but
the writers of Scripture. Not indeed that he ventured upon
any departure from the accepted tradition with regard to the
history of his nation, or the authority of the Old Testament.
On the contrary, he was entirely free from any approach to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213"> 213</span>
critical or inquiring attitude. But in so far he did not teach
like the scribes, that he boldly put forth his own interpretations
of Scripture and his own views of ethics, without the smallest
regard for the established opinions of the schools, and without
seeking support from any authority but his own. In this course
he was evidently strengthened by an inward conviction that he
was the destined Messiah of the Jewish people. Deputed, as
he conceived, directly from God, he could afford to slight the
restrictions which others might place upon their conduct. He
was not bound by the rules which applied to ordinary men.</p>

<p>This assumption, with its corresponding behavior, could not
fail to give great offense to those by whom his title was not
conceded. And we accordingly find that he comes into constant
collision with the recognized legal and religious guides of the
Jews. Among the first of the shocks he inflicted on their sense
of propriety was his claim to be authorized to forgive sins (Mk.
ii. 7). To the Jewish mind this pretension was highly blasphemous;
no one, they thought, could forgive sins but God, and
they did not understand the credentials in virtue of which this
young man acted as his ambassador. Further scandal was
caused by his contempt for the common customs observed on
the Sabbath day (Mk. ii. 24, and iii. 6), which appeared to him
inconsistent with the original purpose of that institution. The
language he was accustomed to use to his disciples, and to his
hearers generally, was not of a nature to soothe their growing
animosity. Designating himself by the Messianic term of "the
Son of man," he announced the approach, even during the generation
then extant, of a kingdom of heaven wherein he himself
was to return clothed with glory, and his followers were to be
gathered round him to enjoy his triumph. Along with these
promises to his friends, there flowed forth indignant denunciation
of the Pharisees and Scribes, who were held up to the
scorn of the populace.</p>

<p>Having thus provoked them to the utmost, he imprudently
accepted the honor of a sort of triumphal entry into Jerusalem,
the pomp of which, however, has probably been somewhat exaggerated
(Mk. xi. 1-11). Nor was this all. He proceeded to an
act of violence which it was impossible for the authorities to
overlook. The current Roman money not being accepted at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214"> 214</span>
temple, the outer court of this building was used by money-changers,
who performed the useful and necessary service of
receiving from those who came to make their offerings the
ordinary coinage, and giving Jewish money instead of it. Doves
being also required by the law to be offered on certain occasions,
there were persons outside the temple who sold these
birds. Indignant at what seemed to him a violation of the
sanctity of the spot, Jesus upset the tables of these traffickers,
and described them all as thieves. It is added in one account
that he interfered to prevent vessels being carried through the
temple (Mk. xi. 15-17). That, after this, the spiritual rulers
should ask him to produce his authority for such conduct, was
not unnatural. Nor is it surprising that, after his unsatisfactory
reply to their inquiry, they should take steps to prevent the
repetition of similar scenes.</p>

<p>The efforts of the chief priests to bring about his destruction
are described in two of our Gospels as the direct result of his
proceedings about the temple, the impression he had made on
the multitude being a further inducement (Mk. xi. 18; Lu. xix.
48). Aware of the indignation he had excited, Jesus soon after
these events retired into some private place, known only to his
more intimate friends. So at least I understand the story of
his betrayal. Either Judas never betrayed him at all, or he was
lurking in concealment somewhere in the neighborhood of Jerusalem.
That the conduct attributed to Judas should be a
pure invention appears to me so improbable, more especially
when the history of the election of a new apostle is taken into
account, that I am forced to choose the latter alternative. The
representation of the Gospels, that Jesus went on teaching in
public to the very end of his career, and yet that Judas received
a bribe for his betrayal, is self-contradictory. The facts appear
to be that Jesus ate the passover at Jerusalem with his disciples,
and that immediately after it, conscious of his growing
danger, he retired to some hidden spot where he had lived before,
and where friends alone were admitted to his company.
Judas informed the authorities of the temple where this spot
was. They thereupon apprehended Jesus, and brought him before
the Sanhedrim for trial.</p>

<p>So confused and imperfect is the account of this trial given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215"> 215</span>
by the Evangelists, that we are unable to make out what was
the nature of the charge preferred against him, or of the evidence
by which it was supported. It is clear, however, that the
gravamen of the accusation was that he had put forth blasphemous
pretensions to be the Messiah, "the Son of the Blessed
One." And this was supported by a curious bit of evidence.
Two witnesses deposed, either that they had heard him say he
<i>would</i> destroy this temple made with hands and build another
made without hands within three days, or that he <i>was able</i> to
destroy the temple, and to rebuild it in three days (Mt. xxvi.
61; Mk. xiv. 58). The witnesses are called false witnesses, both
in Mark and in Matthew. But if we turn to John (Jo. ii. 19), we
find the probable source of the charge brought against him by
these two witnesses, and we find reason also to think that they
were not perjurers. There we are told that after he had driven
the money-changers and traders from the temple, the Jews
asked him for a sign that might evince his right to do such
things. In reply to their demand, Jesus is reported to have
said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up." Connecting this statement in the one Gospel with the evidence
given on the trial according to others, we may form a
tolerably clear notion of the actual fact. Pressed by his opponents
for some justification of his extraordinary conduct, Jesus
had taken refuge in an assertion of his supernatural power. If
they destroyed the temple he would be able, with the favor bestowed
on him by God, to rebuild it in three days. These
words might possibly be misconstrued by some of his hearers
into a threat that he himself would destroy the temple, an outrage
which would in their view have been less difficult to imagine
after his violence to those engaged in business in its
outer court. But whether so understood or not, there could be
no question about the pretension to something like divinity in
the promise to rebuild it in three days. There is not a shadow
of probability in favor of the interpretation put upon the words
in the fourth Gospel, that he spoke of the temple of his body.
And even had that been his secret meaning, the witnesses who
appeared against him could have no conception that he was
thinking of anything but the material temple, to which the
whole dialogue had immediate reference. They were therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216"> 216</span>
simply repeating, to the best of their ability, words which had
actually fallen from the prisoner. The evidence for the prosecution
being concluded, the high priest appealed to Jesus to
know whether he had nothing to reply. Jesus being silent, the
high priest proceeded to ask him directly whether he was
"Christ, the Son of the Blessed One." Jesus answered that he
was, and that they would hereafter see him "sitting on the
right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
Such an answer was an explicit confession of the very worst
that had been alleged against him. After it, there was no
option but to convict him, and we read accordingly that they
all condemned him as worthy of death. But capital punishment
could not be inflicted except by Roman authority. He was
accordingly taken before the procurator, Pontius Pilate, charged
with the civil crime of claiming to be king of the Jews. Pontius
appears to have regarded him as a harmless fanatic, and
to have been anxious to discharge him, in accordance with a
custom by which one prisoner was released at the festival which
fell at this time. But the Jews clamored for the release of a
man named Barabbas, who was in prison on account of his participation
in an insurrectionary movement in which blood had
been shed. Barabbas accordingly was set at liberty, and Jesus,
though with some reluctance on the part of the procurator, was
sentenced to crucifixion. The sentence was carried into effect
immediately. Unable, probably from exhaustion through his
recent sufferings, to carry his own cross, Jesus was relieved of
the burden by one Simon, on whom the soldiery imposed the
duty of bearing it. He was crucified along with two thieves,
and an inscription in which he was entitled "King of the Jews"
was placed upon his cross, apparently in mockery of the Jewish
nation much more than of him. His ordinary disciples had
fled in terror from his melancholy end, but he was followed to
the cross by some affectionate women, who had previously attended
him in Galilee. And after he was dead, his body was
honorably interred by a well-to-do adherent, named Joseph of
Arimathæa.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>The Mythical Jesus.</i></h5>

<p>The life of the mythical Jesus is found in the synoptical
Gospels, but more especially in the first and third. It is by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217"> 217</span>
means pure fiction, but an indistinguishable compound of fact
and fiction, in which the fictitious elements bear so large a proportion
that it is impossible to disentangle from them the elements
of genuine history. Part of this life moreover is wholly
mythical, and of this wholly mythical portion there are certain
sections that are constructed on a common plan, the biographers
in these sections having only fitted the typical incidents in
the lives of great men to the special case of Jesus, the son of
Joseph. Not that this need have been done consciously; the
probability is that the circumstances and mode of thought
which led to the invention of such typical incidents in the lives
of others, led to it equally in that of Jesus. However this may
be, we shall find in the mythical life of Jesus the following
three classes of myths: 1. Myths of the typical order, common
to a certain kind of great men in certain ages, and therefore
purely unhistorical; 2. Myths peculiar to Jesus, in which the
miraculous element so predominates, that it is impossible to
recognize any, or more than the very slightest, admixture of
history; 3. Myths, peculiar to Jesus, in which there is a more
or less considerable admixture of history; And 4. Statements
not of necessity mythical, which may or may not be historical,
but of which the evidence is inadequate.</p>

<p>At the outset of our task we are met by the assumed genealogy
of Jesus, which has caused some trouble to theologians,
and which is mainly important as an indication of the degree
of credit due to writers who could insert such a document. For
these awkward pedigrees afford an absolute proof of the facility
with which the Christians of the earliest age supplemented the
actual life of Jesus by free invention. We are happily in possession
of two conflicting lists of ancestors, and happily also
they are both of them lists of the ancestors of Joseph, who,
according to the very writers by whom they are supplied, stood
in no relation whatever to Christ, the final term of the genealogies.
Double discredit thus falls upon the witnesses. In the
first place, both lists cannot be true, though both may be
false; one of them therefore must be, and each may be, a deliberate
fiction. In the second place, both the Gospels bear
unconscious testimony to the fact that Joseph was originally
supposed to be, by the natural course of things, the father of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218"> 218</span>
Jesus, for otherwise why should the early Christians have been
at the trouble to furnish the worthy carpenter with a distinguished
ancestry? They thus discredit their own story that
Jesus was the son of Mary alone. Either then Jesus was the
son of Joseph, or neither of the two genealogies is his genealogy
at all. The solution of these inconsistencies is to be found
in the fact that two independent traditions have been blended
together by the Evangelists. The one, no doubt the more
ancient of the two, considered Jesus as the child of Joseph and
Mary, and the ingenuity of his biographers has not succeeded
in obliterating the traces of this tradition (Mt. xiii. 55). Another
and much later one, treated him as the offspring of Mary without
the aid of a human father. Those who believed in the first
and more authentic story had busied themselves with the discovery
of a royal descent for their hero, in order that he might
fulfill what they considered the conditions of the Messiahship.
They had naturally traced his ancestry upwards from his
father, not from his mother, according to the usual procedure.
But the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written entirely on
the hypothesis that he had no father but God; all necessity for
showing that Joseph was of the house of David was therefore
gone. Nevertheless the writers or the editors of these Gospels
did not like to neglect entirely what seemed to them to
strengthen their case, and, forgetful of the ridiculous jumble
they were making, inserted an elaborate pedigree of Joseph
along with the statement that Jesus was not his son.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the genealogies in detail, placing them
in columns parallel to one another. Luke begins a stage
earlier than Matthew, making God his starting-point instead of
Abraham. From Abraham to David the two authorities proceed
together. Matthew, who has cut his genealogical tree into
three sections of fourteen generations each, makes this his first
division. After this the divergence begins:—</p>

<p>Various observations offer themselves on these discrepant
genealogies. In the first place it will be observed that Matthew,
in his anxiety to show that the whole period comprised is
divisible into three equal parts of fourteen generations each,
has actually omitted no less than four generations contained in
the authorities he followed. For since he traced the descent of
Joseph through the royal line of Judah, we are enabled to check
his statements by reference to the Book of Chronicles (1 Chron.
iii.), and thus to convict him of positive bad faith. In the first
instance he omits three kings, representing Uzziah as the son
of Joram, who was his great great grandfather; in the second
he passes over Jehoiachim, making Jehoiachin the son instead
of the grandson of Josiah. In the third period we have no
authority by which to verify his statements beyond Zerubbabel,
but his determination to carry out his numerical system at all
hazards is shown by the double reckoning of Jehoiachin, at the
close of the second and the beginning of the third division.
The latter has in fact but thirteen generations, and it was only
by this trick—a little concealed by the break effected through
his allusion to the captivity—that the appearance of uniformity
was maintained. Luke has adopted a different method. Leaving
the line of kings, he connects Joseph with David through
Nathan instead of Solomon. Now beyond the fact that Nathan
was the offspring of David and Bathsheba, nothing whatever is
known about him. Indeed it may have been his very obscurity,
and the consequent facility of creating descendants for him,
that led to his selection in preference to Solomon, though
unless it were that his name stood next above Solomon's (2
Sam. v. 14)—there is no obvious reason for his being preferred
to several other children of David. However, he answered the
purpose as well as any, and after him it was not a difficult
operation to invent a plausible list of names to fill up the gap
between him and Joseph. The compiler of the list in Matthew
had the advantage in so far that he did not require to draw on
his imagination except for nine names between Zerubbabel and
Joseph, while the compiler of the list in Luke had to supply
the whole period from Nathan downwards with forefathers.
But the second compiler had the advantage over the first inasmuch
as his fraud did not admit of the same easy exposure by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221"> 221</span>
reference to its sources, and it was, on the whole, a safer course
to desert history altogether than to falsify it in favor of an
arithmetical fancy.</p>

<p>Another discrepancy between the two writers remains to be
noted; it is the enormous disproportion in the number of generations
between David and Joseph. Matthew has twenty-five
generations, and Luke forty, excluding Joseph himself. A difference
of this magnitude—involving something like 400-450
years—is not to be surmounted by any process of harmonizing.
To which it may be added that the two Evangelists, by assigning
to Joseph different fathers, clearly inform us that his true
father was unknown.</p>

<p>We have here, in short, an excellent instance of the first
order of myth, or myth typical. It has been a common practice
in all ages, more especially among ignorant and uncultivated
nations, to endow those who had risen from obscurity to greatness
with illustrious ancestors. Royal connections have always
been regarded with especial favor for such purposes. Thus, the
Buddha is represented as the descendant of the great Sakya
monarchs. Thus, the ancestors of Zarathustra, in the genealogy
provided for him in Parsee authorities, were the ancient kings
of Persia. Thus, Moslem biographers declare that Mahomet
sprang from the noblest family of the noblest nation, and many
historians give him even a princely lineage (L. L. M., vol. i. p.
140). Thus, according to Sir John Davis, "the pedigree or Confucius
is traced back in a summary manner to the mythological
monarch <i>Hoang-ty</i>, who is said to have lived more than two
thousand years before Christ" (Chinese, vol. ii. p. 45). Thus,
the founder of Rome was placed by popular legend in a family
relationship to Æneas.</p>

<p>Leaving these genealogies—which are important only from
the light they shed on the literary character of their authors
and transmitters—we pass to the first legend directly concerning
Jesus himself, that of his birth. Here again the second
and fourth Evangelists are silent, leaving us to suppose that
Jesus was the natural son of Joseph and Mary, and certainly
never hinting that they entertained any other belief
themselves. But the first and third each relate a little fable on
this subject, though unhappily for them the fables do not agree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222"> 222</span>
Both had to observe two conditions. The first was that Jesus
should be born of a virgin mother; the second that he should
be born at Bethlehem. Matthew accomplishes this end by
informing us that Mary, when espoused to Joseph, was found to
be with child. Joseph, who thereupon contemplated the rupture
of his engagement, was informed by an angel in a dream
that his bride was with child by no one but the Holy Ghost;
that she was to bear a son, and that he was to call him Jesus.
Being satisfied by this assurance, he married Mary, but
respected her virginity until she had brought forth her first-born
son, whom in obedience to his dream he named Jesus.
The child was born in Bethlehem where it would appear from
this account that Mary lived, and it is only after a journey to
Egypt that this Gospel brings the parents of Christ to Nazareth
where a tradition too firm to be shaken placed their residence
(Mt. i. 18-25; ii. 23).</p>

<p>Widely different is the treatment of this subject in Luke.
According to him there was a priest named Zacharias whose
wife Elizabeth was barren. The couple were no longer young,
but they were not old enough to have lost all hope of progeny,
for we are told that when Zacharias was engaged in his duties
in the temple, an angel appeared to him and informed him
that his prayer was heard, and that his wife was to have a son
whom he was to call John. Zacharias had therefore been praying
for offspring, though when the angel—who announced himself
as Gabriel—appeared, he was troubled with some impious
doubts, in punishment of which he was struck dumb. After this
Elizabeth conceived, and went into retirement. From five to
six months after the above scene Gabriel was again despatched
from heaven, this time to a virgin named Mary, living at Nazareth.
Arrived at her house, he addressed her thus: "Hail,
thou that art highly favored; the Lord is with thee; blessed art
thou among women." Seeing Mary's confusion he reassured her;
and informed her that she should have a son called Jesus, who
was to possess the throne of David, and reign over the house of
Jacob forever. Like Zacharias, Mary was disposed to raise
troublesome questions, and she accordingly inquired of Gabriel
how she could bear a child, "seeing I know not a man." But
Gabriel was ready with his answer. The Holy Ghost would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223"> 223</span>
come upon her; moreover, her cousin Elizabeth had conceived
(which, however, was not a parallel case), and nothing was
impossible with God. Soon after this visit, Mary went to see
Elizabeth, who interpreted an ordinary incident of pregnancy
as a sign that the fruit of Mary's womb was blessed, and that
Mary was to be the mother of her Lord. The virgin replied in
a very elaborate little speech, which if uttered must have been
carefully prepared for the occasion. In due time the child of
Zacharias and Elizabeth was born, and named John by his
parents' desire. What Joseph thought of his bride's condition
we are not told, nor do we know whether she made known to
him her interview with the angel Gabriel. At any rate he did
not repudiate her, for we find him taking her with him, about
five months later, to Bethlehem, for the purpose of the census
which took place when Quirinus was governor of Syria, his
descent from David requiring him to attend at that town. During
this census it was that Jesus was born, and because of the
crowded condition of the inn at this busy time, he was placed
in a manger (Lu. i. 1; ii. 7). There let us leave him for the
present, while we compare these narratives with others of a
like description.</p>

<p>Birth in some miraculous or unusual manner is a common
circumstance in the lives of great persons. We have here therefore
another instance of the typical species of myth. Thus, in
classical antiquity, Here is said to have produced Hephaistos
"without the marriage bed" (Bib., i. 3-5). Turning to a remote
part of the globe, there was in the present century a person
living in New Zealand who, according to native tradition, was
"begotten by the attua," a species of deity, "his mother being
then unmarried. The infant was produced at her left arm-pit,
but there was no visible mark left.... He is held as a
great prophet; when he says there will be no rain there will be
none" (N. Z., p. 82). An example of the same kind of legend
occurs in the ancient history of China. The hero is one How-tseih,
who was the founder of the royal house of Chow. His
mother, it appears, was barren, like Elizabeth, for she "had
presented a pure offering and sacrificed, that her childlessness
might be taken away." Her devotion received a fitting reward,
for:—</p>

<p>The gestation of the Buddha was in many ways miraculous.
He entered the womb of his mother by a voluntary act, resigning
his abode in heaven for the purpose. At the time of his descent
upon earth Mâyâ Devi dreamt that a white elephant of singular
beauty had entered into her, a dream which portended the
future greatness of the child (R. T. R. P., vol. ii. p. 61). During
the time of his remaining in the womb, his body, which was
visible both to his mother and to others, had a resplendent and
glorious appearance.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> "Mâyâ the queen, during the time that
Bodhisattva remained in the womb of his mother, did not feel
her body heavy, but on the contrary light, at ease and in comfort,
and felt no pain in her entrails. She was nowise tormented
by the desires of passion, nor by disgust, nor by trouble, and
had no irresolution against desire, no irresolution against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225"> 225</span>
thought of evil or of vice. She suffered the sensation neither
of cold, nor of heat, nor of hunger, nor of thirst, nor of trouble,
nor of passion, nor of fatigue: she saw nothing of which the
form, the sound, the smell, the taste and the touch did not
seem to her agreeable. She had no bad dreams. The tricks of
women, their inconstancy, their jealousy, the defects of women
and their weaknesses, she did not share" (Ibid., vol. ii. p. 77).
And although it is never expressly stated that the Buddha's
nominal father had no part in his production, it is remarkable
that at the time of her conceiving, Mâyâ was living in a place
apart from him, having craved permission to retire for a season,
to practice fasting and penance. During this time she had
told the king that she would be "completely delivered from
thoughts of stealing, desire and pride," and that she would not
"yield to one illicit desire" (R. T. R. P., vol. ii. pp. 54, 55).
Some sects of Buddhists are more explicit, and maintain that
Bodhisattvas do not pass through the earlier stages of fœtal
development; namely, those of <i>Kalalam</i>, mixing up, the period
of the first week, when the future body is like milk: <i>arbudam</i>,
the period of the second week, where a form rises like something
inflated; peci, thickening: and <i>ghana</i>, hardening, the periods of
the third and fourth weeks (Wassiljew, p. 260). But all this does
not exclude the coöperation of a human father. Passing to
another great religion, we find that even the sober philosopher
Confucius did not enter the world, if we may believe Chinese
traditions, without premonitory symptoms of his greatness. It
is said that one day as his mother was ascending a hill, "the
leaves of the trees and plants all erected themselves and bent
downwards on her return. That night she dreamt the Black <i>Te</i>
appeared, and said to her, 'You shall have a son, a sage, and
you must bring him forth in a hollow mulberry tree.'" In
another dream she received a prophecy of the importance of
her coming progeny (C. C., vol. i. p. 59—Proleg.). Another account
states that "various prodigies, as in other instances, were
the forerunners of the birth of this extraordinary person. On
the eve of his appearance on earth, two dragons encircled the
house, and celestial music sounded in the ears of his mother.
When he was born, this inscription appeared on his breast—'The
maker of a rule for settling the world'" (Chinese, vol. ii.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226"> 226</span>
p. 44). The mother of Mahomet is said to have related of her
pregnancy, that she felt none of the usual inconveniences of
that state; and that she had seen a vision in which she had
been told that she bore in her womb the Lord and Prophet of
her people. A little before her delivery the same figure appeared
again, and commanded her to say, "I commend the fruit of
my body to the One, the Eternal, for protection against the
envious" (L. L. M., vol. i. p. 142).</p>

<p>Miraculously born, it was necessary that Jesus should also
be miraculously recognized as a child of no common order.
The story would have been incomplete without some one to
acknowledge his superhuman character even in his cradle.
Matthew and Luke again accomplish the common end by widely
different means. Luke's is the simpler narrative, and it will be
more convenient to begin with. He tells us that there were in
the same country, that is, near Bethlehem, shepherds watching
their flocks. An angel appeared to them and said that a Savior,
Christ the Lord, was born in the city of David. They were to
know him by his being in a manger wrapped in swaddling
clothes. In this humility of his external circumstances immediately
after birth, as in the supernatural recognition which he
received, he again resembles the Chinese hero. How-tseih</p>

<p>"And suddenly," the narrative in Luke proceeds, "there was
with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God
and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth the
peace of good-will among men'" (Lu. ii. 8-14). Similar demonstrations
of celestial delight were not wanting at the birth of
the Buddha Sakyamuni. He was received by the greatest of the
gods, Indra and Brahma. All beings everywhere were full of
joy. Musical instruments belonging to men and gods played of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227"> 227</span>
themselves. Trees became covered with flowers and fruit. There
fell from the skies a gentle shower of flowers, garments, odoriferous
powders, and ornaments. Caressing breezes blew. A
marvelous light was produced. Evil passions were put a stop
to, and illnesses were cured; miseries of all kinds were at an
end (R. T. R. P., vol. ii. pp. 90, 91). So also we read in Moslem
authorities that at the birth of Ali, Mahomet's great disciple,
and the chief of one of the two principal sects into which Islam
is divided, "a light was distinctly visible, resembling a bright
column, extending from the earth to the firmament" (Dervishes,
p. 372). But let us complete the narrative in Luke.</p>

<p>Urged by the angelic order, the shepherds went to Bethlehem
and found the infant Christ, whose nature, as revealed by
the angels, they made known to the people with whom they
met. Returning, they praised and glorified God for all they had
heard and seen (Lu. ii. 15-20).</p>

<p>Quite dissimilar is the form in which the same incident appears
in Matthew. Here, instead of shepherds, we have magi
coming from the East to discover the King of the Jews. A star
in the East had revealed to them the birth of this King of the
Jews <i>de jure</i>, and in the search for him they run straight into
the very jaws of Herod, the king <i>de facto</i>. The author is obliged
to make them take this absurdly improbable course for the sake
of introducing Herod, whom he required for a purpose shortly
to be explained. How utterly superfluous the visit to Herod was
is evinced by the fact that, after that monarch has found out
from the chief priests the birthplace of the Messiah, the magi
are guided onwards by the star, which had been omitted from
the story since its first appearance in order to allow of their
journey to Jerusalem, a mistake for which the star could not
be made responsible. However, after leaving Herod, they were
led by that luminary to the very spot where Christ lay. On
seeing the infant they worshiped him, and offered him magnificent
presents, after which a dream informed them—what their
waking senses might surely have discovered—that it was not
safe to return to Herod after having thus acknowledged a rival
claimant to the throne. They accordingly went home another
way.</p>

<p>Interwoven with this visit of the magi we have a myth which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228"> 228</span>
belongs to a common form, and which in the present instance
is merely adapted to the special circumstances of the age and
place. I term it the myth of <span class="allsmcap">THE DANGEROUS CHILD</span>. Its general
outline is this: A child is born concerning whose future greatness
some prophetic indications have been given. But the life
of this child is fraught with danger to some powerful individual, generally
a monarch. In alarm at his threatened fate, this
person endeavors to take the child's life; but it is preserved by
the divine care. Escaping the measures directed against it, and
generally remaining long unknown, it at length fulfills the
prophecies concerning its career, while the fate which he has
vainly sought to shun falls upon him who had desired to slay
it. There is a departure here from the ordinary type, inasmuch
as Herod does not actually die or suffer any calamity through
the agency of Jesus. But this failure is due to the fact that
Jesus did not fulfill the conditions of the Messiahship, according
to the Jewish conception which Matthew has here in mind.
Had he—as was expected of the Messiah—become the actual
sovereign of the Jews, he must have dethroned the reigning
dynasty, whether represented by Herod or his successors. But
as his subsequent career belied these expectations, the Evangelist
was obliged to postpone to a future time his accession to
that throne of temporal dominion which the incredulity of his
countrymen had withheld from him during his earthly life (Mt.
xxiv. 30, 31; xxv. 31 ff.; xxvi. 64).</p>

<p>In other respects the legend before us conforms to its prototypes. The
magi, coming to Herod, inquire after the whereabouts
of the king of the Jews, whose star they have seen in
the East. Herod summons the chief priests and scribes to council,
and ascertains of them that Christ was to be born at Bethlehem.
This done, he is careful to learn from the magi the
exact date at which the star had appeared to them. He further
desires them to search diligently for the young child, that he
also may worship it. They, as previously related, returned home
without revisiting Herod, whereupon that monarch, in anger at
the deception practiced upon him, causes all the children under
two years of age, in and about Bethlehem, to be slaughtered.
All is in vain. Joseph, warned by a dream, had taken his wife
and step-son to Egypt, where they remained until after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229"> 229</span>
death of Herod, when another dream commanded them to
return. When afraid to enter the dominions of Archelaus, another
of these useful dreams guided them to Galilee, where they
took up their quarters at Nazareth (Mt. ii).</p>

<p>How wide-spread and of what frequent recurrence is this
myth of the Dangerous Child, a few examples may suffice to
show. In Grecian mythology the king of the gods himself had
been a dangerous child. The story of Kronos swallowing his
children in order to defeat the prophecy that he would be dethroned
by his own son; the manner in which Rhea deceived
him by giving him a stone, and Zeus, armed with thunder and
lightning, deposed him from the government of the world, are
familiar to all (Bib. 1. 1. 5-7, and 1. 2. 1). If we descend from
gods to heroes, we find a similar legend related of Perseus,
whose grandfather, Akrisios, vainly tried to avert his predicted
fate, first by scheming to prevent his grandson's birth, and
then by seeking to destroy him when born (Ibid., 2. 4. 1. 4.);
and of Oidipous, who in spite of the attempt to cut short his
life in infancy, inevitably and unconsciously fulfilled the oracle
by slaying his father and marrying his mother. Within historical
times, Kyros, the son of Kambyses is the hero of a similar
tale. His grandfather, Astyages, had dreamt certain dreams
which were interpreted by the magi to mean that the offspring
of his daughter Mandane would expel him from his kingdom.
Alarmed at the prophecy, he handed the child to his kinsman
Harpagos to be killed; but this man having entrusted it to a
shepherd to be exposed, the latter contrived to save it by exhibiting
to the emissaries of Harpagos the body of a stillborn
child of which his own wife had just been delivered. Grown to
man's estate, Kyros of course justified the prediction of the
magi by his successful revolt against Astyages and assumption
of the monarchy (Herodotos, i. 107-130). Jewish tradition, like
that of the Greeks and the Persians, has its dangerous child in
the person of the national hero Moses, whose death Pharaoh
had endeavored to effect by a massacre of innocents, but who
had lived to bring upon that ruler his inevitable fate. From
these well-known examples it is interesting to turn to the
chronicles of the East-Mongols, and find precisely the same tale
repeated there. We read that a certain king of a people called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230"> 230</span>
Patsala, had a son whose peculiar appearance led the Brahmins
at court to prophesy that he would bring evil upon his father,
and to advise his destruction. Various modes of execution having
failed, the boy was laid in a copper chest and thrown into
the Ganges. Rescued by an old peasant who brought him up
as his son, he in due time learnt the story of his escape, and
returned to seize upon the kingdom destined for him from his
birth. This was in <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 313 (G. O. M., pp. 21, 23). This universal
myth—of the natural origin of which it would lead me too
far to speak—was now adapted to the special case of Christ,
who runs the usual risk and escapes it with the usual good
fortune of dangerous children.</p>

<p>Having thus preserved the infant Christ from the dangers
that threatened him, Matthew tells us absolutely nothing about
him until he has arrived at manhood, and is ready to enter on
his public life. Luke is much less reticent. True, he knows
nothing whatever of the star that appeared in the East; nothing
of Herod's inquiries as to the birthplace of Christ; nothing
of the massacre of the innocents, nor of the flight into
Egypt and the return from that country to Nazareth. On the
contrary, his narrative by implication excludes all this, for he
makes Joseph and Mary go up to Bethlehem for the census
only, and return to Nazareth soon after it; so that Herod could
have had no occasion to kill the infants up to the age of two
years, for Christ could not have been above a few weeks old at
most (Lu. ii. 39). Moreover, we learn definitely from one verse
that his parents went up <i>from Nazareth</i> to Jerusalem every
year at the passover (Ibid., ii. 41). But the absence of any
statements like those just taken from the first Gospel is amply
compensated in the third by several pleasing details relating to
his infancy and boyhood. In the first place we learn that after
eight days he was circumcised, and named Jesus according to
the angel's desire (Ibid., ii. 21). Next, we are told that after
his mother's purification—which would last thirty-three days
after the circumcision—she and his step-father took him to the
temple to be presented, and to make the customary offering.
There was in the temple a man named Simeon who had been
promised by the Holy Ghost that he should not die till he had
seen Christ. This man, who came by the Spirit into the temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231"> 231</span>
took the baby in his arms and gave vent to his emotion in the
beautiful little hymn known as the <i>Nunc Dimittis:</i>—"Now, O
Lord, thou dost release thy servant according to thy word in
peace, because mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou
hast prepared before the face of all nations; a light for the
revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel"
(Lu. ii. 29-32).</p>

<p>Less exquisite in its simplicity, but not altogether dissimilar
in tone, is the prophecy of the Rishi Asita on the infant
Buddha. This old and eminent ascetic had come to see the
child whose marvelous gifts had been known to him by supernatural
signs. Having embraced its feet, and predicted its
future preëminence, he had surprised the king by bursting into
tears and heaving long sighs. Questioned about the meaning of
this he replied: "Great king, it is not on account of this child
that I weep; truly there is not in him the smallest vice. Great
king, I am old and broken; and this young prince (Literally,
Sarvarthasiddha) will certainly clothe himself with the perfect
and complete intelligence of Buddha, and will cause the wheel
of the law that has no superior to turn.... After becoming
Buddha he will cause hundreds of thousands of millions of
beings to pass to the other border of the ocean of wandering
life, and will lead them forever to immortality. And I—I shall
not see this pearl of Buddhas! Cured of illness, I shall not be
freed by him from passion! Great king, that is why I weep,
and why in my sadness I heave long sighs" (R. T. R. P., vol. ii.
pp. 106, 107).</p>

<p>So Abd-al-mottalib, Mahomet's grandfather, on seeing his
grandchild immediately after his birth, is reported to have
exclaimed: "Praise be to Allah, who has given me this glorious
youth, who even in the cradle rules over other boys. I commend
him to the protection of Allah, the Lord of the four elements,
that he may show him to us when he is well grown up. To
his protection I commend him from the evil of the wicked
spirit" (L. L. M., vol. i. p. 143).</p>

<p>Prognostications of greatness in infancy are, indeed, among
the stock incidents in the mythical or semi-mythical lives of
eminent persons. Not content with Simeon's recognition, Luke
introduces an old prophetess called Anna, living in the temple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232"> 232</span>
and represents her as giving thanks, and speaking of the child
to all who looked for redemption in Jerusalem (Lu. ii. 36-38).</p>

<p>Twelve years are now suffered to elapse without further
account of the young Jesus than that he grew and strengthened,
filled with wisdom, and that the grace of God was upon him
(Ibid., ii. 40). At twelve years old, the blank is filled by a single
event. His parents had gone to Jerusalem to keep the passover,
taking Jesus with them. On their way back they missed
him, and having failed to find him among their traveling companions,
returned to look for him at Jerusalem. There they
found him in the temple sitting among the doctors of the law,
listening to them and putting questions. Those who heard him
are said to have been astonished at his intelligence. Questioned
by his mother as to this extraordinary conduct, he replied,
"How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be
about my Father's business?" (Lu. ii. 41-50.) Were this incident
confirmed by other authorities, and did it stand in some kind
of connection with the events that precede and follow it, we
might accept it as a genuine reminiscence of the boyhood of
Jesus. That a precocious boy, eager for information, should
take the opportunity of a visit to the headquarters of Hebraic
learning to seek from the authorities then most respected a
solution of questions that troubled his mind, would not in
itself be so very surprising. And those who are familiar with
the kind of inquiries made by clever children, especially on
theological topics, will not think it strange that his youthful
wits should occasionally be too much for those of professed
theologians. But the isolation in which this single event stands
in the first thirty years of Christ's life, and the total absence of
confirmation from any other source, compel us to regard it as
an invention designed to show an early consciousness in Jesus
of his later mission, and also to prove the inability of the doctors
to cope with him. We must, therefore, reject it along with
the other myths of the infancy, of which some are typical
myths, others (like this) myths peculiar to Jesus, but none in
the smallest degree historical.</p>

<p>Before entering on the later life of Jesus, let us note certain
differences between Matthew and Luke in their treatment of
the infancy, which will confirm the above conclusion. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233"> 233</span>
first place, it is to be observed that they effect the desired end
by totally unlike methods. Given the problem of getting the
infant Christ born without the assistance of a father, there were
various ways in which readers could be assured of the truth of
such a miracle. One was to inform Joseph in a dream of the
coming event; another was to announce it to Mary by means
of an angel. In choosing between these expedients each
Evangelist is guided by his own idiosyncrasy. Matthew selects
the dream; Luke the angel; and it is noteworthy that on other
occasions they exhibit similar preferences. Matthew gets out
of every difficulty by a dream. In the course of his two first
chapters he uses this favorite contrivance no less than five
times; four times for Joseph, and once for the magi (Mt. i. 20,
and ii. 12, 13, 22). Twice, it is true, he mentions an angel of
the Lord as appearing in the dream, but the angel in his narrative
plays a very subordinate part, and is, indeed, practically
superfluous. With Luke, on the contrary, the principal agent
in the events of the infancy is the angel, who supplies the
place of the dream in Matthew. An angel informs Zacharias
that his wife is to have a son; an angel declares to Mary that
she is destined to give birth to the Son of God; an angel
announces that event to the shepherds after its occurrence; and
angels appear in crowds above them as soon as the announcement
has been made (Lu. i. 11, 26, and ii. 9, 13). Another striking
difference is the extreme fondness of Matthew for ancient
prophecies, and of Luke for little anthems and for songs of praise.
The diverse natures of the two writers are well exemplified by
this distinction; the former being the more penetrated with the
history and literature of the Jewish race; the latter the more
flexible and the more imbued with the spirit of his age.
Hence, Matthew almost avowedly constructs his narrative in
such a manner as to ensure the fulfillment of the prophecies.
After describing Mary's miraculous conception, he says that all
this was done to fulfill Isaiah's words: "Behold, a virgin shall
conceive" (more accurately; the maiden has conceived), "and
shall bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" (Mt. i. 23;
Isa. vii. 14). And this he quotes, regardless of the fact that
Christ never was called Immanuel, and that if the one clause
of the prophecy is to be understood literally, so must the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234"> 234</span>
Thus also he reveals his reason for assigning to Bethlehem the
honor of being Christ's birthplace, when he places in the
mouths of the priests at the court of Herod a verse from
Micah, in which it is asserted that from Bethlehem Ephratah
shall come a man who is to be ruler in Israel (Mt. ii. 6; Mic. v.
2). Further, he massacres the innocents in order to corroborate
a saying of Jeremiah (Mt. ii. 18; Jer. xxxi. 15), and he takes
Joseph and Mary to Egypt to confirm an expression of Hosea
(Mt. ii. 15; Hos. xi. 1). In each case, he perverts the natural
sense of the prophets; for in Jeremiah, the children are to
return to their own land, which the innocents could not do; and
in Hosea, the son who is called out of Egypt is the people of
Israel. Lastly, in his exceeding love of quoting the Old Testament,
he commits the most singular blunder of all in applying
to Christ the words spoken of Samson by the angel who
announced his birth. If, indeed, the allusion be to this passage
(and it can scarcely be to any other), the Evangelist is barely
honest; for he converts the angelic words, "he shall <i>be a Nazarite</i>,"
into the words "he shall <i>be called a Nazarene</i>" (Mt. ii.
23; Judg. xiii. 5). So Judaic a writer could hardly be ignorant
that a Nazarite was not the same thing as an inhabitant of
Nazareth. But from whatever source the quotation may come,
its object plainly is to lead to the belief that notwithstanding
his birth at Bethlehem, Jesus was called by his contemporaries
a Nazarene.</p>

<p>Luke does not trouble himself with the search for ancient
oracles, but indulges a far freer and more inventive genius.
His personages give utterance to their feelings in highly finished
songs, which are sometimes very beautiful, but most certainly
could never have been uttered by the simple people to
whom he attributes them. Among these are the salutation of
Elizabeth to Mary, and the still more elaborate answer of Mary.
Zacharias, the very instant he recovers his speech, recites a
complete hymn of no inconsiderable length (Lu. i. 68-79).
Again, Simeon expresses his joy at the birth of the Savior in a
similar manner (Ibid., ii. 29-32); but in his case it may be said
that he had so long expected to see the Christ that his hymn
of thanksgiving might well be ready.</p>

<p>Passing now to the manhood of Jesus, we find the four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235"> 235</span>
Evangelists all agreed in recording the baptism by John as the
earliest known event in his adult career, and it is unquestionably
with this consecration by a great man that his authentic
life begins. Mark and John indeed were unaware of anything
previous to this period, and the former introduces it by the
words, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son
of God" (Mk. i. 1), showing that for him at least the history
of his Master began at this point. As usual, the myth appears
in its simplest form in his pages. After applying to John the
Baptist a prophecy by Isaiah, he states that this prophet was
engaged in baptizing in the wilderness, and that all Judea and
all the Jerusalemites went out to him and were baptized, confessing
their sins. He declared that a mightier than he was
coming after him, the latchet of whose shoes he was unworthy
to unloose. Jesus, like the rest of the world, went to be baptized,
and as he came out of the water he saw the heavens
opened, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. There
was a voice from the heavens, "Thou art my beloved Son, in
thee I am well pleased." Matthew and Luke describe the baptism
of John in a similar manner, Matthew adding a conversation
between Jesus and John. They also mention the baptism
of Jesus, the descent of the dove, and the voice, but with slight
variations. For whereas Mark merely says that <i>Jesus saw</i> the
heavens opened and the Spirit like a dove descending, and
Matthew, in substantial accordance with him, relates that the
heavens were opened [to him], and that <i>he saw</i> the Spirit descend
as a dove, Luke going further, pretends that the heavens
were opened, and that the spirit did descend in a bodily form
like a dove upon him (Mk. i. 1-12; Mt. iii.; Lu. iii. 1-22). Thus
is the subjective fact in the consciousness of Jesus gradually
changed into an objective fact, a transition deserving to be noted
as illustrative of the trivial changes of language by which a
myth may grow. Several other examples of a like process will
meet us in the course of this inquiry. The scene at the baptism
is described differently again in the fourth Gospel. There the
testimony of John the Baptist to Christ is rendered far more
emphatic; he receives him with the words, "Behold the Lamb
of God, who taketh away the sins of the world;" and he explains
his knowledge of him by the fact that he has received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236"> 236</span>
a special revelation concerning him. On whomsoever he saw
the Spirit descend and remain, that was he who was to baptize
with the Holy Ghost. Now he had seen the Spirit descend
like a dove on Jesus, and therefore had borne witness that
he was the son of God (John i. 6-37). Of the opening of the
heavens and of the voice nothing is said, and the meaning
of the whole story evidently is that this descent of the Spirit
was a private sign arranged between God and John the Baptist,
but of which the bystanders either perceived nothing, or
understood nothing. For had they known that the Holy Ghost
itself was thus bearing witness to Jesus, what need was there
of the witness of John? It is evident, however, that even if
they saw the dove flying down and alighting upon Jesus, they
were not informed that it represented the Holy Spirit. Thus the
whole fact is reduced to a peculiar interpretation given by John
to a natural occurrence. We have then three versions of the
baptismal myth:—in the first certain circumstances are perceived
by Jesus; in the second they are perceived by John; in
the third they actually occur.</p>

<p>Strangely inconsistent with this distinct acknowledgment of
Christ as the son of God, is the inquiry addressed to him at a
subsequent period by John the Baptist through his disciples.
It appears that on hearing of the extraordinary fame of Jesus
and of the course he was pursuing, John sent two disciples
from the prison where he was confined to put this question to
him, "Art thou he that should come, or do we expect another?"
in other words, Are you the Messiah? Thus interrogated, Jesus
replied, not by appealing to the testimony of the dove at his
baptism, or the voice from heaven, but by citing the miraculous
cures he was then performing. Nor did he in the least resent
the doubt implied in John the Baptist's query. On the contrary,
he immediately entered upon a glowing panegyric of his
precursor, describing him as the messenger sent before his face
to prepare his way, and as the prophet Elias who was expected
to come—(Mt. xi. 1-15; Lu. vii. 18-30)—a title which in another
Gospel the Baptist had expressly repudiated (Jo. i. 21). This
remarkable transaction between the two teachers could not
easily have occurred, if the elder had previously discovered "him
that should come" in the person of Jesus. For then we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237"> 237</span>
suppose that since the baptism he had seen reason to hesitate
as to the correctness of his opinion. And in that case, could he
have referred the question to Jesus himself for his decision?
And could Jesus have employed the terms of praise here given,
in speaking of one who had lapsed from his former faith into
a state of doubt? Plainly not. The Evangelists have overshot
the mark in their narrative of the baptism. Eager to make
John bear witness to Jesus, they have forgotten that it was
only at a later period that he was convinced—if he was convinced
at all—of the Messianic claims of the young man who
had passed under his influence, and derived from him some of
his earliest inspirations. His doubts are historical; his conviction
is mythical.</p>

<p>Temporary retirement into solitude naturally followed upon
the consecration administered by John in the baptismal rite.
Jesus spent some time wandering in a lonely place, the period
of forty days assigned to this purpose being naturally suggested
by the forty years of Israel's troubles in the wilderness. If
there mingled among his meditations any lingering feelings of
reluctance to follow the course pointed out by the Baptist, he
would have afterwards described such feelings as temptations of
the devil. Hence, it may be, the story of his conversations
with Satan. These are not alluded to at all in Mark, who
simply mentions the fact that he was tempted by Satan. Neither
is there any reference in Mark to fasting for the whole of the
forty days or any part of them. Greatly improving upon this
bald version, the other two Synoptics tell us that he ate nothing
during all this time, and describe the very words of his dialogues
with the tempter. Satan had besought him to make
bread out of stones; to cast himself down from a high place,
and to accept at his hands all the kingdoms of earth in return
for a single act of worship (Mk. i. 12, 13; Mt. iv. 1-11; Lu. iv.
1-13). Jesus, like the Buddha at the corresponding period of
his life, emerged triumphant from the trial. It was by no
means equal in severity to that which Sakyamuni underwent.
He also was obliged to overcome the devil before he could
attain perfection. "Mârâ, the sinner," the Indian Satan, assailed
him not only by force of arms, despatching an immense army
against him; but finding this onslaught a failure, he tried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238"> 238</span>
subtler mode of attempting to corrupt his virtue by the seductions
of women. His beautiful daughters were despatched with
orders to display all their charms, and employ all their fascinations
before the young monk. They faithfully executed the
commission, but all was in vain. Calm and unmoved, the Bodhisattva
regarded them with complete indifference, and emerged
from this severest of trials a perfect Buddha (R. T. R. P., vol.
ii. p. 286-327). In like manner Zarathustra was tempted by the
Parsee devil, Angra-mainyus, who held out a promise of happiness
if he would but curse the good law. Like Jesus, Zarathustra
repelled the suggestion with indignation: "I will not curse
the good Mazdayasna law, not even if limbs, soul, and life were
to part from one another" (Av., vol. i. p. 244.—Fargard xix. 23-26).</p>

<p>Not long after his return from the desert, Jesus took up his
abode at the village of Kapharnaoum, or Capernaum, in Galilee,
Nazareth being in several ways uncongenial to him (Mk. ii. 1;
Mt. iv. 12-16). In the first place it was the abode of his family,
who did not believe in the pretensions he now began to advance.
Moreover, he was well known to the Nazarenes as the
carpenter, or the carpenter's son, and it seemed an unwarrantable
presumption in their young townsman, undistinguished by
advantages either of birth or education, to claim to become
their teacher (Mk. vi. 3). His relations also not only discredited
him by their unbelief, but occasionally took active measures to
stop his proceedings (Mk. iii. 21, 31). From these and perhaps
other causes, he entirely failed to accomplish any important
miracle at Nazareth, and he had to excuse his failure by the
remark that a prophet is not without honor except in his own
country, among his own relations, and in his own house (Ibid.,
vi. 4). The more natural version—that of Mark—adds that he
marvelled because of their unbelief. With less simplicity Matthew
relates, not that he was unable to do, but that he did not
do many mighty works there because of their unbelief (Mt. xiii.
54-58). Further confirmation of the incredulity of the Nazarenes
is afforded by their reception of a remarkable sermon said to
have been delivered by Jesus in their synagogue. It seems that
after he had preached in various parts of Galilee, and had been
well received, he came to Nazareth and, having read a Messianic
prophecy from Isaiah, proceeded to apply it to himself. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239"> 239</span>
noticed the demand which he expected would be addressed to
him, that he should repeat there such works as he was reported
to have performed at Capernaum, he proceeded to convey by
some pointed illustrations from the Old Testament the unflattering
intimation that Nazareth was to be less favored by God
than his adopted home. Hereupon a storm arose in the synagogue,
and an effort was made by the enraged audience to cast
him from the brow of a hill. But he escaped in safety to his
own residence at Capernaum (Lu. iv. 14-30).</p>

<p>Whether or not any such sermon was preached or any such
attempt upon his life was made, the narrative bears further
witness to the fact of ill success in the town where he had been
brought up, and to his possession of a house or lodging at Capernaum.
Whether he himself was the owner of the abode, or
whether it belonged to a disciple who received him (of which
latter there is no evidence), makes little difference; the representation
afterwards made that foxes had holes, and birds had
nests, but the son of man had not where to lay his head (Mt.
viii. 19, 20; Lu. ix. 57, 58), is equally negatived by either supposition.
Mark and John know nothing of this condition of the
son of man. In John's Gospel, indeed, it is distinctly contradicted
by the statement that two of the Baptist's disciples asked
him to show them where he lived; that he did so, and that they
staid with him that day (Jo. i. 39). Indirect evidence of the
same kind is afforded by the notice of an entertainment given
by Jesus at his own house, to which he invited a very promiscuous
company. Luke, indeed, represents this feast as having
been given by Levi, but this is evidently for the sake of an
artistic connection with the summons to Levi, which in all three
narratives immediately precedes it. For the same reason he
departs from both other Evangelists in making the scribes at
this very feast put the question why Jesus and his disciples did
not fast, which, according to the more trustworthy version, is
put by the disciples of the Baptist (Mk. ii. 18-22; Mt. ix. 14-17;
Lu. v. 33-39). Thus Luke contrives to convert three unconnected
stories into a single connected one. That Jesus received the
more degraded classes of his countrymen on equal terms, and
that his habits were not ascetic, are the important facts which
we have to gather from these several statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240"> 240</span></p>

<p>The inference from the evidence on the whole is that Jesus
was in comfortable, though not opulent circumstances; and
even had he been in want, he had friends enough whose devotion
would never have allowed him to remain without a good
lodging and sufficient food.</p>

<p>These friends he seems to have begun collecting round him as
soon as he entered upon his career of preaching in Galilee.
Among the earliest were four fishermen, Simon and his brother
Andrew, James and his brother John. The first pair of brothers
Jesus called away from their occupation, saying, "Follow me,
and I will make you fishers of men" (Mk. i. 16-20; Mt. iv. 18-22).
So say two Gospels, but a very different account appears in
John. There we are told that two of the disciples of John the
Baptist having heard Jesus, left their master to follow him.
One of these two was Andrew, Simon's brother, and it was
Andrew who went and informed Simon that he had discovered
the Messiah. On seeing Simon, Jesus addresses him, "Thou
art Simon the son of John; thou shalt be called Kephas" (Jo.
i. 38-43). Not a word is said here of the calling of fishermen
pursued by these brothers, nor of the remarkable promise to
make them fishers of men. Moreover it is they who present
themselves to Jesus; not he who summons them. The two accounts
are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Luke has a third version, not absolutely irreconcilable with
that of Mark and Matthew, though inconsistent in all its details.
According to him, Jesus had once been speaking to the
people from Simon's boat, which was lying on the lake of Gennesaret.
The address concluded, he desired Simon to launch
into the lake and let down the nets. Simon replied that they had
toiled all night and caught nothing; yet he would obey. On
casting out the net it was found to inclose so great a multitude
of fishes that it broke. Simon called to his partners, James and
John, to come to his assistance, and both vessels were not only
filled with fish, but began to sink with the weight. Peter,
ascribing this large haul to the presence of Jesus, begged him
to depart from him, for he was a sinful man. Jesus told him,
as in the other Gospels he tells him and his brother Andrew
(who does not appear here), that he shall henceforth catch men.
Hereupon all the three forsook all, and followed him; from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241"> 241</span>
which it must clearly be understood that they had not followed
him before. Thus, that which the simpler version represents
as a mere summons, obeyed at once, is here converted into a
summons enforced upon the fishermen by a professional success
so great as to appear to them miraculous, and to lead in their
minds to the inference that since Jesus had commanded them
to let down the nets, and their obedience had been thus rewarded,
he was in some obscure manner the cause of the good
fortune which had attended their efforts (Lu. v. 1-11).</p>

<p>Leaving aside for the present all that is peculiar to John,
who alone mentions the calling of Philip, there is but one other
disciple concerning whom we have any information as to the
mode in which he was led to join Jesus. This is Levi, or Matthew,
the publican. Jesus found him sitting at the receipt of
custom, and commanded him to follow him, which he instantly
did (Mk. ii. 14; Mt. ix. 9; Lu. v. 27, 28). But we are not compelled
to suppose that from this time forward Levi did nothing
but accompany Jesus or go through the country preaching the
new faith. He may have done so, or he may only have left his
business from time to time to listen to the prophet who had so
deeply impressed him. For while three Evangelists mention
this circumstance, only one of them, and that the least trustworthy,
adds that in following Jesus he left all things.</p>

<p>The names of the other seven disciples are given with but a
single variation in all of the synoptical Gospels (Mk. iii. 14-19;
Mt. x. 1-4; Lu. vi. 12-16). To these twelve their master gave
power to heal diseases and to cast out devils, and sent them
forth into the world to preach the coming of the kingdom of
heaven, giving them instructions as to the manner in which
they should fulfill their mission (Mk. iii. 14, 15; Mt. x. 5-15; Lu.
ix. 1-6). When not thus engaged, they were to remain about
his person, and form an inner circle of intimate friends, to
receive his more hidden thoughts, and help him in the work he
had undertaken.</p>

<p>The four who were the first to join him seem to have stood
towards him in a closer relationship than anyone else, and to
have been in fact his only thorough disciples during the earliest
period of his life. For we read that after the cure of a demoniac
effected in the synagogue at Capernaum (Mk. i. 21-28; Lu. iv.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242"> 242</span>
31-37), he retired into the house of Simon and Andrew, with
James and John, and there healed Simon's mother-in-law of a
fever by the touch of his hands, a species of remedy which
requires no miracle to render it effectual (Mk. i. 29-31; Mt.
viii. 14, 15; Lu. iv. 38, 39). His reputation as a thaumaturgist
had now begun to spread, and crowds of people besieged his
door, whom he relieved of various diseases, and from whom he
expelled many devils (Mk. i. 32-34; Mt. viii. 16, 17; Lu. iv. 40,
41). The anxiety of the devils to bear witness to his Messiahship
he repressed, on this as on other occasions. Mentioning
these circumstances, Matthew, ever prone to strengthen his
case by the authority of a Hebrew prophet, cites Isaiah, "He
himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses." Certainly
not a very happy application of prophecy; since it nowhere
appears that Jesus bore the diseases he cured, or was
possessed by the devils he expelled.</p>

<p>Anxious to escape from the pressure of the people, who clamored
for miracles, he retired to a desert place to pray. But
here Simon and others followed him and told him that all men
were seeking him. He replied that he must carry his message
to other villages also, and proceeded on a tour through Galilee,
preaching and casting out devils (Mk. i. 35-39; Lu. iv. 42-44). It
was on some occasion during this Galilean journey, when crowds,
eager to hear his doctrine and see his wonders, had pressed
around him from every quarter that he delivered the celebrated
sermon the scene of which is laid by Matthew on a mountain,
and by Luke in a plain (Mt. chs. v.-vii., inclusive; Lu. vi. 20-49).
A part only of this discourse has been preserved to us, for
Matthew has evidently collected into one a great number of his
best sayings, which were no doubt actually uttered on many different
occasions and in many different places. Luke, with more
sense of fitness, has scattered them about his Gospel, assigning
to some an earlier, to others a later date. Notably is this unlike
arrangement remarkable in the case of the Lord's prayer, and
in nothing is the untrustworthiness of these Gospels, as to all
exterior circumstances, more conspicuous than in their assigning
to the communication of this most important prayer totally
different times, different antecedents, and different surroundings.
For whereas Matthew brings it within his all-compre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243"> 243</span>hensive
sermon on the mount, Luke causes it to be taught in
"a certain place" where Jesus was praying. The former makes
Jesus deliver it spontaneously; the latter in answer to the request
of a disciple; the former to a vast audience; the latter to
the disciples alone (Mt. vi. 9-13; Lu. xi. 1-4).</p>

<p>Discrepancies like these evince the hopelessness of attempting
to follow with accuracy the footsteps of Christ. We can
obtain nothing beyond the most general conception of his
movements, if even that; and of the order of the several events
in his life we can have scarcely any notion. Discourses, parables,
conversations, miracles, follow one another now in rapid
succession. Leaving the consideration of the doctrines taught
for another place, we will notice here, without aiming at a
chronological arrangement, the principal scenes of his life; and,
beginning with his miracles, we will take before any others
those in which devils are expelled; or as we should say, maniacs
are restored to sanity.</p>

<p>A strange miracle of this kind is related of a man in the
country of the Gadarenes or Gergasenes. Matthew indeed,
according to a common habit of his, has made him into two
men, but the other two Evangelists agree that there was but
one. This man was a raving lunatic, who had defeated every
effort to confine him hitherto made, and who lived among
tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones. Seeing Jesus,
he addressed him as the Son of the Most High God, and adjured
him not to torment him. On being asked his name, he
said it was Legion, for they were many. Having been ordered
out by Jesus, he begged for leave to enter into a herd of swine
which was feeding near at hand; this was granted, and the
herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea and were all
drowned, their number being about two thousand (Mk. v. 1-20;
Mt. viii. 28-34; Lu. viii. 26-39). After this wanton destruction of
property, it is not surprising that the people "began to pray
him to depart out of their coasts." Jesus on this occasion certainly
displayed a singular tenderness towards the devils, and
very little consideration for the unfortunate owners of the pigs.
Nor did the Legion gain much by the bargain; for they lost
their new habitation the moment they had taken possession
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244"> 244</span></p>

<p>The disciples, as we have seen, had received power over
devils, but it appears from a remarkable story that they were
not always able to master them. For on returning to them
after the transfiguration, Jesus found a crowd about them
engaged in some disputation. Having demanded an explanation,
a man told him that he had brought his son, who was subject
to violent fits, probably epileptic (Mark alone makes him deaf
and dumb), and begged the disciples to cure him, which they
had been unable to do. Hereupon, Jesus, bursting into an
angry exclamation against the "faithless and perverse generation"
with whom he lived, took the boy and healed him.
Luke omits the private conversation with the disciples which
followed on this scene. They asked him, it is said, why they
had been thus unsuccessful. The answer is different in Matthew
and in Mark. In the former Gospel, he assigns a plain
reason: "because of your unbelief;" adding afterwards, "this
kind does not come out except by fasting and prayer." In
Mark, the latter statement constitutes the whole reply, no allusion
being made to the disciples' unbelief. It is noticeable,
however, that in Mark alone the father is required to believe
before the boy is healed; a singular condition to exact, since
belief may generally be expected to follow on a miracle rather
than to precede it (Mk. ix. 14-29; Mt. xvii. 14-21; Lu. ix. 37-43).</p>

<p>In the case of the Syro-phœnician woman, however, there
was no need to impose it, for her faith, founded on the reputation
of Jesus was perfect. This woman came to him when he
had gone upon an excursion to the neighborhood of Tyre and
Sidon, and begged him to cast out a devil from her daughter,
who was not present. He at first refused on the ground of her
being a Gentile, but after a remarkable dialogue, confessed
himself convinced by her arguments, and told her that on her
return she would find the daughter cured, which actually happened
(Mk. vii. 24-30; Mt. xv. 21-28). Here we have an instance
of a remedy effected at a distance, which can scarcely be credited
at all unless on the supposition that the daughter knew of
her mother's expedition, and had equal faith in Jesus. The
probability is, however, that her recovery is an invention,
though the argument with the woman may possibly be historical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245"> 245</span></p>

<p>Belief in the production of diseases by demoniacal possession,
and in the power of exorcism over diseases so produced, is
the common condition of mind in barbarous or semi-civilized
nations. The phenomena which occurred in the first century in
Judea are reproduced at the present day in more than one
quarter of the globe. Take, to begin with, the theory of possession
in Abyssinia, which I find quoted by Canon Callaway from
Stern's "Wanderings among the Falashes." Canon Callaway
observes that "in Abyssinia we meet with the word <i>Bouda</i>,
applied to a character more resembling the Abatakadi or wizards
of these parts [South Africa].... The <i>Bouda</i>, or an
evil spirit called by the same name and acting with him, takes
possession of others, giving rise to an attack known as 'Bouda
symptoms,' which present the characteristics of intense hysteria,
bordering on insanity. Together with the <i>Boudas</i> there is, of
course, the exorcist, who has unusual powers, and, like the
<i>inyanga yokubula</i>, or diviner among the Amazulu, points out
those who are <i>Boudas</i>, that is, Abatakati" (R. S. A., part iii. pp.
280, 281). Describing the diseases of the Polynesian islanders,
the missionary Turner says: "Insanity is occasionally met
with. It was invariably traced in former times to the immediate
presence of an evil spirit" (N. Y., p. 221). Rising somewhat
higher in the scale of culture, the Singhalese, as depicted
by Knox, present the spectacle of patients whose symptoms
are an almost exact reproduction of those which afflicted the
objects of the mercy of Jesus. "I have many times," he
relates, "seen men and women of this country strangely possest,
insomuch that I could judge it nothing else but the effect
of the devil's power upon them, and they themselves do
acknowledge as much. In the like condition to which I never
saw any that did profess to be a worshiper of the holy name
of Jesus. They that are thus possest, some of them will run
mad into the woods, screeching and roaring, but do mischief to
none; some will be taken so as to be speechless, shaking and
quaking, and dancing, and will tread upon the fire and not be
hurt; they will also talk idle, like distracted folk." The
author proceeds to say that the friends of these demoniac
patients appeal to the devil for their cure, believing their
attacks to proceed from him (H. R. C., p. 77).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246"> 246</span></p>

<p>The striking successes of Jesus with maladies of this order
naturally brought him the reputation of ability to deal no less
powerfully with other diseases. Accordingly, a leper presented
himself one day, and kneeling to him said that if he wished he
could make him clean. He did so, and the leper, though
enjoined to keep silence, went about proclaiming the power of
Jesus, who was consequently besieged by still further throngs
of applicants and of curious spectators (Mk. i. 40-45; Mt. viii.
1-4; Lu. v. 12-16).</p>

<p>Illustrating the manner in which he was pursued, we find a
curious story. Jesus was in his own house at Capernaum, when
a paralytic, borne upon a couch, was brought to him to be
healed. Unable from the concourse about him to penetrate to
Jesus, his bearers let him down through an opening in the
roof. After forgiving the man's sins, which he claimed a right
to do, he told him to take up his bed and walk. This the paralytic
at once did, to the amazement of the bystanders (Mk. ii.
1-12; Mt. ix. 1-8; Lu. v. 18-26). Matthew, telling the same story,
omits the crowd and the circumstance of letting down the patient
through the roof; and these adjuncts may be fictitious in
the special case, but in so far as they bear witness to the thaumaturgic
repute of Jesus, have in them an element of genuine
history.</p>

<p>Of various other miracles of healing with which Jesus is
credited, one of the most interesting is the alleged resuscitation
of Jairus' daughter. Jairus was a ruler of the synagogue; a
personage therefore of some note in his district; and his daughter,
a little girl of twelve years old, was dangerously ill, and
supposed by her friends to be at the point of death. At this
critical moment Jairus repaired to Jesus, and requested him to
come and lay his hands on the little maid, that she might live.
Jesus consented, but before he could reach the house messengers
arrived who informed Jairus that his child was already dead;
he need not trouble the master. None the less did Jesus proceed
to the house, taking with him only the most intimate disciples,
Peter, James, and John. Here a strange scene awaited
him. About, and probably in the sick-room had gathered a
crowd of people, relations, friends, and dependants of Jairus,
who were engaged in raising a wild clamor of grief around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247"> 247</span>
child. Flute-players were performing on their instruments,
while their lugubrious music was accompanied by the tumultuous
wailing and howling of the mourners. Jesus, having entered
the place, declared that the maiden was not dead, but sleeping;
or as we should say, in a state of insensibility. The people
laughed in derision at the assertion, but Jesus at once took the
very proper and sensible measure of turning them all out of the
room (which was either the sick-room itself or one close to it),
and taking the damsel's hand, commanded her to rise. She did
so, and Jesus (again exhibiting excellent sense) ordered that she
should have something to eat (Mk. v. 21-24, and 35-43; Mt. ix.
18, 19, and 23-26; Lu. viii. 40-42, and 49-56). In this case we have
a peculiarly valuable instance of the manner in which miracles
may be manufactured. Analyzed into its elements of fact and
its elements of inference, we find in it nothing which cannot
be easily understood without supposing either any exercise of
supernatural power or any deliberate fraud in the narrators.
Observe first, that in two out of the three versions the girl is
reported by Jairus not to be dead, but dying. True, before
Jesus can get to her it is announced that she is actually dead.
But Jesus, having reached the house, and having evidently seen
the patient (though this fact is only suffered to appear in Luke's
version), expressly contradicts this opinion, declaring that she
is not dead, but unconscious. On what particular symptom he
founded this statement we do not know, but we cannot, without
accusing Jesus of deliberate untruthfulness, believe that he
made it without reason. At any rate, the measures taken by
him implied a decided conviction of the accuracy of his observation.
If she were, as he asserted, not dead, though dangerously
ill, the hubbub in the house, if suffered to continue, would
very likely have rendered her recovery impossible. Quiet was
essential; and that having been obtained, it was perfectly possible
that under the soothing touch and the care of Jesus she
might awake from her trance far better than before, and to all
appearance suddenly restored to health. The crisis of her case
was over, and it may have been by preventing her foolish
friends from treating that crisis as death, that Jesus in reality
saved her life. And when she awoke, the order to give her food
implied a state of debility in which she could be assisted, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248"> 248</span>
by supernatural, but by very commonplace measures. Observe,
however, the manner in which in this case the myth has grown.
In two of the Gospels, Mark and Luke, Jairus comes to Jesus,
not when his daughter is dead, but only when she is supposed
to be at the last gasp. There is no reason from their accounts
to believe that she died at all, her friends' opinion on that point
being contradicted by Jesus. But in Matthew the miracle is
enhanced by the statement of the father to Jesus that she was
just dead (Mt. ix. 18). Consistently with this account the message
afterwards sent to him from his house is omitted. Again,
while it seems from the manner in which Matthew and Mark
relate what happened, that the words of Jesus, "The maiden
is not dead, but sleepeth," preceded his entry into her room,
it is clear from Luke that they succeeded it. And this is consistent
with the requirements of the case. Some of the mourners
and attendants must obviously have been by the bedside,
and he could not turn them out till he was himself beside it.
Then clearing the sick-chamber of useless idlers, he could proceed
in peace to treat the patient; while if we suppose that
these people were all outside the door, there is far less reason
for their prompt expulsion. That this is the true explanation
of the miracle I do not venture to assert; I have only been
anxious to show, by a single instance, how easily the tale of an
astounding prodigy might arise out of a few perfectly simple
circumstances.</p>

<p>A curious incident took place on the way to the house of
Jairus. A woman who had had an issue of blood for twelve
years, came behind Jesus and touched his clothes, whereupon
she was instantly healed. Jesus, turning round, told her that
her faith had saved her (Mk. v. 25-34; Mt. ix. 20-22; Lu. viii.
43-48). Such is the fact as related by the first Evangelist; but
the other two, magnifying the marvel, place Jesus in the midst
of a throng of people pressing upon him, and make him supernaturally
conscious that some one has touched him in such a
manner as to extract remedial power out of him. Discovered
by this instinct, the woman tremblingly confesses her deed.</p>

<p>Neither contact, however, nor even the presence of Jesus on
the spot, were essential to a miracle of healing. A centurion,
having a paralytic servant, either went or sent others to Jesus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249"> 249</span>
requesting that he would heal him. Before Jesus could reach
the house, he declared that he was unworthy of receiving him
within it, but entreated that the word might be spoken, adding
that his servant would then be healed. This was done; and
Jesus took occasion to point the moral by contrasting the faith
of this heathen with that of the Jews, dwelling on the superior
strength of the former (Mt. viii. 5-13; Lu. vii. 1-10). This myth,
which appears only in two Gospels, and in them with considerable
variations, seems to have been designed to glorify Jesus by
making a Roman officer acknowledge his powers. This intention
is more evident in Luke than in Matthew; for in Matthew
the centurion comes himself; but in Luke he sends "the
elders of the Jews" to prefer his request, their appearance
evincing his importance, and therefore increasing the honor
done to Jesus by the suppliant attitude in which he stands.
When Jesus is near his house the officer still does not approach
in person, but sends friends, distinctly stating that he thought
himself unworthy to come himself, and intimating his belief
that a mere word will be enough to heal his servant. It is
impossible to see why this message might not have been sent
in the first instance by the elders, and the cure effected at once,
but the two embassies to Jesus make a better story. Thus, in
this version the centurion, who in the other version gives an
interesting account of his official status, and receives the highest
praise for his faith, never actually sees Jesus at all; and
the eulogy is spoken not <i>to</i> him, but <i>of</i> him. Here, then, is
another example of the way in which tales of this kind grow in
passing from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>Sometimes much more materialistic means of healing were
adopted. One day, by the sea of Galilee, a deaf and dumb
man was brought to Jesus. In this case he took the man aside,
put his fingers into his ears, spat, touched his tongue, looked
up to heaven, sighed, and said, Ephphatha, or, Be opened (Mk.
vii. 31-37). When a word was sufficient, it was singular to go
through all these performances, and the whole proceeding has
somewhat the air of a piece of jugglery. At Bethsaida he dealt
in like manner with a blind man, leading him out of the town,
spitting upon his eyes, and then putting his hands upon him.
Asked whether he saw, the man replied that he saw men as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250"> 250</span>
trees walking, whereupon a further application of the hand to his
eyes caused him to see clearly (Mk. viii. 22-26). Here the remark
presents itself that if anything of the sort ever occurred, the man
could not have been born blind, since he would then have been
unable to distinguish either men or trees by sight. It must
have been a blindness due to accident or disease of the eyes,
and might not have been total. But the whole story is probably
mythical.</p>

<p>Two more miracles of healing rest on the authority of the
third Gospel alone. By one of them ten lepers, who had asked
for mercy, were suddenly cleansed after they had gone away.
One only of the ten, a Sâmaritan, turned round to glorify God
and to utter his gratitude. Jesus then observes: "'Were not
the ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Were there none
found that returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?'
And he said to him, 'Arise, go; thy faith hath saved thee'"
(Lu. xvii. 11-19). Here the intention of exalting the Sâmaritan
above the Jews is very evident.</p>

<p>Another prodigy was worked at the town of Nain, where the
only son of a widow was just dead, and his body was being
carried out to the burial-place. Jesus touched the bier, and the
widow's son rose to life, to the terror of the spectators, who
declared that a great prophet had been raised up, and that God
had looked upon his people (Lu. vii. 11-17).</p>

<p>Though the miracles of Jesus were principally of a remedial
character, there were others which were rather designed to
evince his power. Conspicuous among this class is that of feeding
a multitude of five thousand people who had followed him
into a desert place, and whose hunger he satisfied by the supernatural
multiplication of five loaves and two fishes (Mk.
vi. 30-45, and viii. 1-9; Mt. xiv. 14-21, and xv. 29-38; Lu. ix.
10-17; Jo. vi. 1-15). Of this wonder a double version, slightly
different in details, has been embodied in the first two Gospels.
It is plainly the same story coming from different sources.
John, whose miracles are seldom identical with those of the
synoptics, relates this one nearly in the same way; except that
according to him it was a lad and not (as in the other Gospels)
the disciples, who had the food on which the marvel was operated.
The number of persons is stated in all four Gospels to be five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251"> 251</span>
thousand (and on the second occasion in the two first Gospels
four thousand); but Matthew alone has striven to enhance the
miracle still further by adding to these numbers the words,
"besides women and children."</p>

<p>Immediately after this miracle the disciples entered a boat
to cross the lake of Galilee, leaving their master on land. A
storm overtook them at night, and as they were laboring through
it, they saw Jesus walking towards them on the water. Alarmed
at such an apparition they cried out in fear; but Jesus reassured
them, and was received into their boat, whereupon the
wind fell (Mk. vi. 45-52; Mt. xiv. 22-33; Jo. vi. 16-21). To this
Matthew, unlike Mark and John, adds that Peter also attempted
the feat of walking on the lake; but being timid, began to
sink, and had to be rescued by Jesus. John alone adds to the
first miracle a further one: namely, that immediately upon his
entrance into the ship, they were at the land whither they went.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar performance is that of stilling a violent
storm on the lake of Galilee, which seems to have astonished
even the disciples in the boat, accustomed as they must have
been to prodigies. At least their exclamation, "What sort of
man then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
looks as if all his influence over devils and diseases had failed
to convince them of his true character (Mk. iv. 35-41; Mt. viii.
23-27; Lu. viii. 22-25).</p>

<p>All doubt upon this score must have been removed in the
minds of three at least of the disciples by a scene which occurred
in their presence. Peter, James and John accompanied
him one day to a high mountain, where he was transfigured
before them; his raiment becoming white and shining. Elijah
and Moses were seen with him, and Peter, evidently bewildered,
proposed to make three tabernacles. A voice came from heaven:
"This is my beloved son: hear him." Suddenly the apparition
vanished; Jesus alone remained with the disciples, and on the
way down charged them to tell no one of what they had seen
till after the resurrection (Mk. ix. 2-13; Mt. xvii. 1-13; Lu. ix.
28-36). This is a suspicious circumstance, which means, if it
mean anything, that the transfiguration was never thought of
till after the death of Jesus, and that this order of his was invented
to account for the otherwise unaccountable silence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252"> 252</span>
the three disciples. For is it to be imagined that Peter,
James, and John could keep the secret of this marvelous event,
which was so well fitted to confirm the faith of believers, and
to convince the Jews in general of the Messianic nature of the
prophet? And if they did keep the secret, what weight is to
be attached to their evidence, given long after the event, and
when exalted views of the divinity of the Christ who had risen
from death were already current?</p>

<p>Such are some of the "mighty works" for which Jesus
claimed, and his disciples yielded, the title of "son of man,"
or "son of God," and assumed the authority of the "Messiah"
whom the Jewish nation expected. But this claim was recognized
neither by the spiritual heads of the Jews, nor by the
great bulk of the people. Indeed he had given great offense to
their religious sentiment both by putting forward such pretensions,
and by the opinions he had expressed on various topics.
The language which had caused their hostility, as belonging to
his historical and not to his mythical personality, will be considered
elsewhere. But the accounts—semi-mythical, semi-historical—which
have reached us of the closing scenes of his life,
must be passed under review now.</p>

<p>Long before his actual arrest, the Gospels tell us that he
had predicted to his disciples the sufferings that were to befall
him. Peter, according to one of the versions, had remonstrated
with him on these forebodings, and had received from him in
consequence one of the sharpest reprimands he had ever given,
with the opprobrious epithet of "Satan." It is further stated
that he prophesied his resurrection, and his return to earth in
glory with the angels of his Father. To this was added another
prediction which proved false, that there were some standing
there who should not taste of death till the son of man came
in his kingdom. Gloomy expressions as to the necessity of his
followers taking up their crosses and being ready to lose their
lives also escaped him (Mk. viii. 31-ix. 1; Mt. xvi. 21-28; Lu. ix.
22-27). A little later, he is said to have distinctly given vent to
similar expectations as to his approaching end, though without
being able to make himself understood by his disciples (Mk.
ix. 30-32; Mt. xvii. 22, 23; Lu. ix. 44, 45). Again, on the way to
Jerusalem where he intended to celebrate the passover, he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253"> 253</span>
all his twelve disciples aside, and distinctly foretold his execution
there, and his resurrection on the third day (Mk. x. 32-34;
Mt. xx. 17-19; Lu. xviii. 31-34).</p>

<p>Those portions of his prophecies which related to his death
at the hands of the Jewish rulers, though not those which related
to his return in glory, were destined to be soon fulfilled.
Determined to insist publicly upon his title to the Messianic
throne, Jesus resolved upon a triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
Having sent two disciples from the Mount of Olives to fetch a
colt, hitherto unridden, which he informed them the owners
would surrender on hearing that the Lord had need of it, he
mounted this animal and rode into the city amid the shouts
and acclamations of his supporters. Many are said to have
spread their garments in his path; others to have cut down
branches from trees, and strewed them before him. Those that
went before and behind him kept cheering as he rode, exclaiming:
"Hosanna, blessed is he who cometh in the name of the
Lord; blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David;
hosanna in the highest" (Mk. xi. 1-11; Mt. xxi. 1-11; Lu. xix.
29-39; Jo. xii. 12-16).</p>

<p>This remarkable scene is described in all the Gospels; but
while the three first represent Jesus as sending to fetch the
colt, or the ass and colt, which he in some mysterious manner
knows that the man will give up, the fourth makes him take
the ass and mount it; not as in the other versions before the
triumphal reception, but after it had begun. So that as to these
important circumstances the two accounts are entirely at issue;
that of John being the more natural. That Jesus actually
entered Jerusalem in this fashion is highly probable, for we
find in the Gospels themselves a motive assigned which might
well have led him to select it for his approach to the capital.
There was a prophecy in Zechariah with which he was no doubt
familiar: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion: shout, O daughter
of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee, just and
victorious is he; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
foal, the young of asses" (Zech. ix. 9). With the views he held
as to his Messiahship, Jesus may well have been anxious to
show that this prophecy was fulfilled in his person.</p>

<p>On the day after his entry on the ass, on coming from Beth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254"> 254</span>any
he was hungry, and finding a fig-tree without fruit, he
cursed it. Mark says that the disciples found it withered the
next day; Matthew increasing the marvelous element, that they
saw it wither "immediately." Mark also adds that it was not
the season for figs, which, if correct, would have made it
absurdly irrational in Jesus to expect them (Mk. xi. 12-14, and
20-26; Mt. xxi. 18-22). If we accept the more natural supposition
that it was the season, but that this individual tree was
barren, then we may easily understand that the absence of
fruit and the withered condition of the tree were both parts of
the same set of phenomena, and that the disciples may have
observed them about the same time.</p>

<p>Human beings were the next victims of the wrath of Jesus.
The money-changers and dove-sellers were turned out of the
temple by him; the fourth Gospel alone mentioning a scourge
of small cords as the weapon employed (Mk. xi. 12-14; Mt.
xxxi. 12, 13; Lu. xix, 45, 46; Jo. ii. 15-18). A question put
by the authorities as to his right to act thus was met by a
counter-question, and finally left unanswered (Mk. xi. 27-33; Mt.
xxi. 23-27; Lu. xx. 1-8.). The chief priests now consulted
together as to the measures to be taken with a view of bringing
him to trial, but hesitated to do anything on the feast-day
for fear of popular disturbances. Matthew tells us, what the
other two do not know, that they assembled at the palace of
the high priest Caiaphas, and also puts in the mouth of Jesus
a distinct prophecy that after two days he will be betrayed to be
crucified (Mk. xiv. 1, 2; Mt. xxvi. 1-5; Luke xxii. 1, 2.).</p>

<p>A similar foreboding is expressed, according to Matthew,
Mark, and John, in reference to an incident which is variously
described by these three Evangelists. Matthew and Mark agree
in saying, that on this occasion he was taking a repast at the
house of Simon the leper, when a woman came up to him with
a box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head.
Here, according to Mark, "some," according to Matthew, "the
disciples," were indignant at the waste of the ointment, which
might, they said, have been sold "for much," or "for three
hundred pence," and the proceeds given to the poor. But
Jesus warmly took up the woman's cause, for, he remarked,
"she has wrought a good work on me. For you always have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255"> 255</span>
the poor with you, but me ye have not always. For in pouring
this ointment on my body she has done it for my burial."
Mark now how strangely this simple story has been perverted
in the fourth Gospel to suit the purposes of the writer. The
date he assigns to it—six days before the passover—is nearly
the same as that given in the second Gospel, where it is placed
two days before that festival. The place, Bethany, is also
identical. But the other circumstances are widely different. In
this Gospel alone is anything known of an intimate friend of
Jesus, Lazarus by name. In it alone is there any mention of
one of his most astounding miracles, the restoration of Lazarus
to life. Consistently with his peculiar notion of the relations of
Jesus with this man's family he says nothing of Simon the
leper, but without telling us in whose house Jesus was, mentions
that Lazarus was among the guests, and that his sister
Martha was serving. Further, he asserts that the woman who
brought the ointment was Mary, the other sister. Instead of
pouring it on his head, she is made to anoint his feet, and wipe
them with her hair. Instead of the disciples, or some unknown
people, being angry at the waste, it is Judas Iscariot in whose
mouth the obnoxious comment is placed. The sum he names,
three hundred pence, is the same as that assigned in Mark as
the value of the ointment. But in order to cover Judas with
still further obloquy, the Evangelist charges him with a desire
to obtain this sum, not for the poor, but for himself; he being
the bearer of the common purse, and being in the habit of dishonestly
appropriating some portion of its contents (Mk. xiv.
3-9; Mt. xxvi. 6-13; Jo. xii. 3-8). Of such an accusation not a
trace is to be found in the other Gospels, whose writers were
assuredly not likely to spare the reputation of Judas if it were
open to attack. Nor does the author of this insinuation offer
one particle of evidence in its support.</p>

<p>The steps by which a story grows from an indefinite to a
definite, from a historical to a mythical form, are admirably
illustrated in this instance. A tradition is preserved in which,
while the main event is clear, many of the surrounding circumstances
have been suffered to escape from memory. Writer
after writer takes it up, and finding it thus imperfect, adds to
it detail after detail until its whole complexion is altered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256"> 256</span>
Even the main event may not always be exempted from the
transfiguring process; as here, where the feet of Jesus are substituted
for the head, and the interesting picture introduced of
Mary wiping them with her hair, and consequently placing herself
in a situation of the deepest humility. And if the central
incident is thus unsafe, still more so are its adjuncts. First,
the woman is unknown, as are those who murmur against her.
Then, in the second stage, the woman is still unknown, but the
murmurers are known generally as the disciples. But no bad
motive is as yet assigned for their censure. Lastly, in the
third stage, the woman is known, the murmurer is known
specifically as <i>one</i> disciple, and a bad motive is assigned for his
censure. Such is the way in which myths grow up.</p>

<p>The circumstance we have next to deal with is obscure, not
because too much has been added, but because something has
been omitted. Jesus had now drawn upon him the mortal
hatred of the priests of the temple. He was well aware of his
danger, as many of his expressions show. He endeavored to
avoid it by living in concealment in or near Jerusalem. Not
that we are told of this in so many words, but that the course
of the story renders it a necessary assumption. For all the
Gospels inform us that one of his disciples, Judas named
Iscariot, went to the chief priests and betrayed him, receiving
a pecuniary reward for the service thus rendered (Mk. xiv. 10,
11; Mt. xxvi. 14-16; Lu. xxii. 3-6; Jo. xiii. 2, 27). As to this fact
there is complete unanimity, and it is borne out by the manner
of his arrest as subsequently depicted. We cannot then treat it
as a fiction; but it is plain that had Jesus been leading the
open and public life described in the Gospels, there would have
been no secret to betray, and no reward to be earned. A period,
more or less long, of retirement to some spot known only to
friends, must therefore be taken for granted. John alludes to
something of the sort, though not distinctly, when he relates
that there was a garden across the brook Cedron, to which he
often resorted with his disciples, and which was known to
Judas. But the Christian tradition did not like to acknowledge
that Christ, whom it represents as braving death, ever lurked
in hidden places like a criminal, and at the same time it wished
to brand the memory of Judas with infamy. Hence the sup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257"> 257</span>pression
of a fact without which the story cannot be understood.
The expressions, "he sought how he might conveniently
betray him" (Mk. xiv. 11); or "he sought opportunity to betray
him" (Mt. xxvi. 26), plainly point to the same inference.</p>

<p>There are some differences in the manner in which the proceedings
of Judas are related. All the Gospels agree that he
received money, but Matthew alone knows how much. This
Evangelist had in his mind a passage in Zechariah, which he
erroneously attributes to Jeremiah, and which moreover he misquotes
(Mt. xxvii. 9). In the original it runs thus: "And I said
unto them [the poor of the flock], If it is good in your eyes,
give me my hire; and if not, forbear. And they weighed for
my hire thirty pieces of silver."<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Matthew and Mark merely
state that Judas betrayed his master, giving no reason for his
conduct. Luke, however, represents it as a consequence of
Satan having entered into him (Lu. xxii. 3); while John in like
manner states that the devil put it into his heart, and even
knows the very moment when Satan entered into him (Jo. xiii.
2, 27). This Evangelist alone places the first steps taken by
Judas after the last supper, instead of before it, and strangely
enough so arranges the course of events, that he only acts upon
the resolution to betray him after a distinct declaration by Jesus
that he was about to do so.</p>

<p>Slightly anticipating the course of the narrative, we may
mention here the singular myth of the unhappy end of the
traitor Judas; a myth which is of peculiar interest inasmuch as
its origin is distinctly traceable to a mistranslation of a verse
in Zechariah. The passage quoted above continues thus: "And
Jehovah spoke to me: Throw it to the treasure, the costly
mantle with which I am honored by them; and I took the
thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the temple of
Jehovah to the treasure." But the word here used for the treasure
commonly signifies potter, and was hence interpreted "Throw
it to the potter." Out of this mistake arose the story that
Judas, ashamed of his bargain, returned the money to the chief
priests, who, deeming it unlawful to put it in the treasury,
bought therewith the "potter's field to bury strangers in."<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258"> 258</span>
Thus, observes Matthew, "was fulfilled that which was spoken
by Jeremy the prophet." Judas, having parted with his ill-gotten
gain, committed suicide by hanging (Mt. xxvii. 3-10). So at
least says Matthew; but Luke, making confusion worse confounded,
represents Judas himself as purchasing the field "with
the reward of iniquity;" after which he fell headlong, and
bursting in the middle, his bowels gushed out (Acts i. 18, 19).
Of this notorious fact, "known," according to the Acts of the
Apostles, "to all the dwellers at Jerusalem," Matthew at least
was wholly ignorant. But both versions equally originate in
the defective Hebrew of the translators of Zechariah.</p>

<p>In all the synoptical Gospels, the celebration of the passover
by Jesus and his disciples succeeds the secret arrangement
of Judas with the high priests. He kept it in Jerusalem, in the
house of a man whose name is not mentioned, but who must
have been one of his adherents. The encounter with this man
is represented in two of the three versions as something miraculous.
On the first day of unleavened bread Jesus told two of
his disciples (according to Mark), James and John (according to
Luke), to go into Jerusalem, where they would meet a man
bearing a pitcher of water. Him they were to follow, and
wherever he went in, they were to say to the master of the
house, "Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover
with my disciples?" He would then show them a large
furnished upper room, where they were to prepare it. Nothing
but a perfectly natural version of all this appears in Matthew.
There Jesus tells his disciples to go into the city to So-and-so
(the name therefore having been given), and tell him that he
wished to keep the passover at his house (Mk. xiv. 12-16; Mt.
xxvi. 17-19; Lu. xxii. 7-13). Here again we see how easily a wondrous
tale may originate in a very simple fact.</p>

<p>Supper was accordingly prepared in the man's house, and
Jesus ate the passover there with his disciples. At this supper,
according to all the Gospels, he mentioned the fact that one of
them would betray him. Whether in so doing he actually
named the traitor is uncertain. Mark's account is that when he
had predicted that one would betray him, the disciples in sorrow
inquired one by one, "Is it I?" and that Jesus told them
it was the one who dipped with him in the dish. Luke leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259"> 259</span>
it still more indefinite. There Jesus merely says, "the hand of
him that betrays me is with me on the table," and no further
inquiry is made by any one. Matthew, like Mark, represents
each disciple as asking whether he was the one, and Jesus as
giving the same indication about the dish. But he adds that
Judas himself asked, "Is it I?" and that Jesus answered,
"Thou hast said." Quite different is the account in John.
There, instead of all the disciples inquiring whether it was he,
a single disciple, leaning on the breast of Jesus, asks, on a
sign from Peter, who it was to be. Jesus does not reply that it
was he who dipped in the dish, but he to whom he should give
a sop. He then gives the sop to Judas, and tells him to do
quickly that which he is about to do; words understood by no
one present.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The improbability of any of these stories is
obvious. In the three first, Judas is pointed out to all the
eleven as a man who is about to give up their master to punishment,
and probable death, yet no step was taken or even
suggested by any of them either to impede the false disciple in
his movements, or to save Jesus by flight and concealment.
The announcement is taken as quietly as if it were an every-day
occurrence that was referred to. John's narrative avoids
this difficulty by supposing the intimation that Judas was the
man to be conveyed by a private signal understood only by
Peter and the disciple next to Jesus. These two may have felt
it necessary to keep the secret, but why then could they not
understand the words of Jesus to Judas, or why not at least
inquire whether they had reference to his treachery, which had
just before been so plainly intimated? That Jesus, with his
keen vision, may have divined the proceedings of Judas, is
quite possible; that he could have spoken of them at the table
in this open way without exciting more attention, is hardly
credible.</p>

<p>It was at this same passover that Christ, conscious of his
approaching end, blessed the bread and the cup of wine, and
giving them to his disciples, told them that the one was his
body, and the other his blood in the new testament, or the new
testament of his blood (Mk. xiv. 22-25; Mt. xxvi. 26-29; Lu. xxii.
14-21; I Cor. xi. 23-25). John who was confused about dates in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260"> 260</span>
his biography, supposes that this supper took place before the
feast of the passover, instead of at it, and, consistently with
this view, he says nothing of the institution of the Eucharist,
which had a peculiar reference to the Jewish feast-day. Instead
thereof, he introduces another ceremony, of which neither the
other Evangelists nor Paul say a word; that of washing the
disciples' feet by Jesus. This was done to make them "clean
every whit" (though it had no such effect on Judas), and also
to set them an example of mutual kindness (Jo. xiii. 4-17).</p>

<p>The passover eaten, Jesus retired with his disciples to the
Mount of Olives. Being in a prophetic mood, he foretold that
all his disciples would forsake him in the hour of danger now
approaching, and that Peter would deny him. This Peter
resented, though it was destined to be soon fulfilled. After this
Jesus went to Gethsemane, and taking his three principal disciples
apart from the rest, told them that his soul was sorrowful
unto death, and begged them to remain and watch while he
prayed. Going a little forward, he prayed earnestly that the
coming trial might pass from him, yet with submission to
God's will. Returning, he found his three friends asleep, and
this happened twice again, these devoted men sleeping calmly
on until the very moment when the officers of the Sanhedrim
came to arrest their Lord. Luke adorns this scene—which he
places at the Mount of Olives without mentioning the garden
of Gethsemane—with ampler details. Mark and Matthew know
nothing of the exact distance of Jesus from his disciples; Luke
knows that it was about a stone's throw. Moreover, all the
number are present, not only Peter, James, and John. Sweat
like drops of blood falls from Christ. An angel appears to
strengthen him. All this is new; as is the representation that
the disciples were sleeping from sorrow,—a motive which the
Evangelist no doubt felt it needful to assign in order to vindicate
their honor. The other two biographers, who content
themselves with saying that "Their eyes were heavy," certainly
keep more within the limits of probability (Mk. xiv. 32-42;
Mt. xxvi. 36-46; Lu. xxii. 39-46).</p>

<p>No sooner was the prayer concluded than Judas, accompanied
by a large <i>posse comitatus</i> armed with swords and staves,
came from the Jewish authorities. Resistance to the arrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261"> 261</span>
must have been expected, and not wholly without reason; for
as soon as the officers, in obedience to the preconcerted signal
of a kiss from Judas, had seized Jesus, one of his party drew a
sword and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. This
incident is related in various ways in all the Gospels. In Mark,
Jesus addresses no rebuke to the disciple who commits this
action. In Matthew, he tells him to put up his sword, for all
who take the sword shall perish by the sword. In Luke, the
progress to greater definiteness which has been noted as characterizing
these semi-historical myths has begun. In the first
place, before going to the Mount of Olives, the disciples provide
themselves with two swords; and Jesus, on their mentioning
the fact, says, "It is enough." Then the writer knows that
it was the right ear which was cut off. More than this, he
gives artistic finish to the whole by making Jesus touch the
place and heal the wound: though whether a new ear grew, or
the old one was put on again, he does not tell us. More definite
still is the version in John. This Evangelist, as we saw in
another case, is fond of supplying names. Thus, he pretends
to know here that it was Peter who cut off the ear, and that its
owner was called Malchus. Peter is called to order in his version,
but Malchus is not healed. Plainly it was the sense of
justice of the third Evangelist that made him shrink from leaving
an innocent dependent in this mutilated condition, when he
knew that Christ might so easily have restored the missing
member.</p>

<p>While in the synoptical Gospels it is Judas who by a kiss
points out Jesus, in John it is Jesus himself who comes forward
to declare himself. Hereupon the party deputed by the priests
go backwards and fall to the ground. They soon recover themselves
enough to arrest him. In all the versions he suffers
himself to be quietly taken, while in all but John he resents,
with much dignity, the sending of such a force against him, as
though he had been a thief; while in fact he had often taught
openly in the temple and had not been stopped. Their master
once taken, the courage of the disciples was at an end. They all
fled. Jesus was brought before the Sanhedrim, and evidence,
of the tenor of which we are not informed, was produced
against him. Lastly, two witnesses deposed that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262"> 262</span>
heard him say, "I am able to destroy this temple, and in three
days to rebuild it;" or, "I will destroy this temple made with
hands, and will build another not made with hands in three
days." Mark endeavors to depreciate these witnesses by saying
that their evidence did not agree; and he himself is liable to
the remark that his report of their evidence does not agree with
that of Matthew, while in neither Gospel does the utterance
attributed by these men to Jesus tally exactly with that assigned
to him in John, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will
raise it up" (Jo. ii. 19). The agreement, however, is close enough
to render it probable that some such expression was used, and
some such evidence given. Neither Luke nor John know anything
of witnesses against Jesus. But Luke, in common with
the other synoptical Gospels, asserts that he not only admitted,
but emphatically confirmed the charge—distinctly put to him
by the high priest—of being the Son of God. On this confession
he was unanimously found guilty of blasphemy.</p>

<p>Wholly different is the conduct of the trial in John, whose
account, moreover, is confused and ill-written in the extreme.
With his usual proneness to give names, he says that Jesus was
taken first before Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas the high
priest. Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas. The high priest
(the council is not alluded to) carried on an informal conversation
with Jesus, inquiring about his doctrine and disciples;
questions which the latter, on the plea of the publicity of his
teaching, refused to answer. There is no mention of blasphemy;
no conviction on any charge; no expression of opinion on the
part of Caiaphas; though from the fact that he committed the
prisoner for trial before the Roman court, it may be inferred
that he considered him guilty.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>During the trial by the Sanhedrim, a singular scene was
passing in the ante-room. There Peter, who alone of the disciples
had followed his master (for the mention of another is
peculiar to John), was warming himself among the attendants.
Questioned by maids and officers of the court whether he had
not been among the disciples of the accused, he vehemently,
three several times, repudiated the supposition, though his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263"> 263</span>
Galilean accent told heavily against him. According to John,
the question was put on the third occasion by a relative of
Malchus, who had seen him in the garden. The other Evangelists
are less specific. Now Jesus had foretold that Peter
would thus deny him, and that his falsehoods would be followed
by the crowing of a cock. Immediately after the last
denial, this signal occurred; and Peter, according to all the
Gospels but the fourth, went out and wept over his meanness.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Convicted by the Sanhedrim, the prisoner was now placed at
the bar of the civil tribunal. The procurator of Judea at this
time was a man named Pontius Pilatus. His character does
not stand high. Neander terms him "an image of the corruption
which then prevailed among distinguished Romans" (Leben
Jesu, p. 687). Appointed in the year 23, he was recalled in 37
on account of the slaughter of some Sâmaritans in a battle.
He had insulted the prejudices of the people he governed by
setting up the standards of the Roman army within the walls
of Jerusalem, and had threatened an armed attack upon the
peaceable Jews who went to Cæsarea to remonstrate against
this novel measure. On another occasion he had taken some of
the revenues of the temple to construct an aqueduct, and when
the work was interrupted by the people, had set disguised soldiers
upon them, who killed them without mercy.</p>

<p>Such a man was not likely to be excessively troubled by
scruples about the execution of an innocent victim. On the
other hand it is perfectly possible that he might, comparing
the prisoner with the prosecutors, prefer the former. Having
no love for the Jewish people, an object of their antipathy
might become to a certain extent an object of his sympathy.
But beyond this, it would be absurd to suppose that a man of
the character of Jesus would inspire him with any sort of regard,
or that he would hesitate to take his life if it suited his
purpose. The simplest account of the trial bears out this expectation.
Questioned by Pilate as to the charge preferred
against him, of claiming to be the king of the Jews, the prisoner
answered by an admission of its truth: "Thou sayest it."
To other accusations urged against him by the priests he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264"> 264</span>
no reply. Pilate wondered at his silence, and endeavored, but
without success, to extract an answer. While the conduct of
the accused man must have appeared to him not a little strange,
Pilate may also have thought that the pretensions to kingship
of a peaceable fanatic, with but few and obscure followers, were
nowise dangerous to the Roman government. It was his custom
at this festival to release a prisoner, leaving the people, or
the Jewish authorities, to decide whom. He now proposed to
release Jesus, but the suggestion was not accepted, and the
liberation of a well-known political prisoner, who had been
engaged in an insurrectionary enterprise, was demanded instead.
Pilate naturally enough preferred the would-be Messiah to the
actual rebel. The Jews as naturally preferred the rebel. They
clamored for the crucifixion of Jesus, and Pilate—afraid perhaps
that by too much anxiety to save him he would expose
himself to misrepresentation before Tiberius—gave way to their
demand.</p>

<p>So far Mark; and as to the charge against Jesus, and the
procurator's treatment of it, the other Evangelists are all at
one with him. But each has adorned the trial with additional
incidents after his own fashion. Matthew has a ridiculous story
of an interference with the course of justice by Pilate's wife,
who on the strength of a dream entreated him to have nothing
to do with "that just man." Matthew, as we have seen before,
was a great believer in dreams. Then he is so desirous of
clearing the character of the Roman, that he describes him as
washing his hands in token of his innocence before the multitude,
who cry out that the blood of Jesus is to be on them and
their children. In Luke, there is a new variation. Learning
that Jesus was a Galilean, Pilate sent him to Herod, who had
long been anxious to see him, but who could not now induce
him to answer any of his questions. Herod, like Pilate, found
no fault in him, and sent him back after treating him with ridicule.
Pilate's reluctance to convict Jesus is much magnified in
this Gospel. He insists on Herod's inability, as well as his own,
to discover any capital offense committed by him, and three several
times proposes to the prosecution to chastise him and then
dismiss him. In John, the conversation of Pilate with Jesus is
wholly different. In the first place, it takes place alone, or at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265"> 265</span>
any rate in the absence of the accusers, for these had refused
to be defiled by entering the court; and Pilate is represented
as going out to them to inquire into the charge. This is to
suit the blunder about dates committed in this Gospel, according
to which the last supper was before, and the trial at the
very time of, the passover. The Jews, therefore, stand without,
and the prisoner is within. The prisoner does not refuse, as in
all the other versions, to answer Pilate's questions, but enters
at some length into his doctrine, explaining the unworldly
nature of his kingdom. Pilate places the purple robe and the
crown of thorns upon him before his condemnation, instead of
after it, and then tells the Jews that he finds no fault in him.
Yet after this he desires them to crucify him, although he was
guiltless. Hereupon the Jews tell him that he had made himself
the Son of God. At this, Pilate is frightened, and enters
into further conversation with Jesus. After hearing him expound
another theory, he is still very anxious to release him,
but is forced to yield by an intimation that no friend of Cæsar's
would protect a rival to the throne (Mk. xv. 1-14; Mt. xxvii. 1,
2, and 11-25; Lu. xxiii. 1-23; Jo. xviii. 28-40). Anything more
utterly improbable than this scene it is difficult to imagine.
The picture of the Roman governor of Judea going backwards
and forwards between accusers and accused; listening to the
theological fancies of the accused; helpless against the pressure
of the accusers; alarmed at the pretensions to divinity of a
young Galilean artisan; are sufficient in themselves to stamp
this Gospel with the mark of unveracity.</p>

<p>Sentenced to death, Jesus was now scourged; a purple robe
was put upon him, and a crown of thorns about his head (not
upon it as was afterwards said): he was saluted in mockery as
king of the Jews, and smitten with a reed upon the head. After
this cruel ceremony he was led out to Golgotha to be crucified,
a man named Simon being compelled to bear his cross (Mk. xv.
15-21; Mt. xxvii. 26-32; Lu. xxiii. 24-26; Jo. xix. 1-16). Luke is
singular in the introduction of a large company of women who
follow Jesus to the crucifixion and draw from him a prophecy
of terrible evils to come upon them and their children; for
themselves, and not for him, they were to weep (Lu. xxiii.
27-31). The other versions say nothing of any friends or follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266"> 266</span>ers,
male or female, as being present at this period, though
they do mention many women as looking on from a distance
during the crucifixion. These, however, were not daughters of
Jerusalem (like the women in Luke), but Galilean admirers who
had followed him to the capital. His mother was certainly not
among them, or she could not fail to have been mentioned in
the synoptical Gospels; whereas the only names we meet with
are those of Mary Magdalene; Mary, mother of James and
Joses; and Salome, apparently the same person as the mother
of Zebedee's children (Mk. xv. 40, 41; Mt. xxvii. 55, 56).</p>

<p>These were among the spectators of the melancholy end of
him who had been their teacher and their friend. He was crucified
between two criminals, with an inscription on his cross
which is differently reported in every Gospel, but of which the
substance was that he was the king of the Jews. A stupifying
drink which Matthew (in accordance with a supposed prophecy)
(Ps. lxix. 21) calls vinegar and gall, was offered him by the
executioners; not as Luke supposes, in mockery, but with the
humane intention of allaying the pain. His clothes were divided
among the party of soldiers; a circumstance in which the Evangelists
as usual endeavor to see the fulfillment of prophecy.
In Psalm xxii. 18, we read: "They part my garments among
them, and cast lots upon my vesture." The Synoptics content
themselves here with stating that the soldiers drew lots for his
clothing, but John anxious to fulfill this prophecy in the
most literal manner possible, pretends that they divided
the articles of his apparel into four parts, but finding the coat
without seam, agreed not to tear it, but to apportion it by lot.
Luke is the sole reporter of a saying of Jesus uttered in his
last moments: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do" (Mk. xv. 23-28; Mt. xxvii. 34-38; Lu. xxiii. 32-34, 36;
Jo. xix. 17-24).</p>

<p>The pangs of death must have been greatly embittered to
Jesus if it be true that not only the priests and passers by, but
the very criminals who were crucified with him, ridiculed his
claim to be king of Israel, and suggested that he should prove
it to demonstration by saving himself from the cross. All the
synoptical Gospels agree in this account, with the single exception
that Luke includes only one of the malefactors among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267"> 267</span>
scorners. According to this Gospel, the other rebuked his fellow-convict
for his misbehavior, and addressed to him a few
moral remarks; which, however, were perhaps not quite disinterested,
for at its close he requested Jesus to remember him
in his kingdom, and received an ample reward in the shape of
a promise from the latter that he should be with him that day
in Paradise. But where was the impenitent criminal to be?
About his fate there is an ominous obscurity, and it evidently
did not occur to the writer that the forgiveness which Jesus
had just been praying his Father to grant his enemies, he
might himself have extended to this miserable man (Mk. xv.
29-32; Mt. xxvii. 39-44; Lu. xxiii. 35-43).</p>

<p>Another incident of the closing hours of Jesus is known to
the fourth Evangelist alone. According to the others, the
women who watched him expire were standing far off. But
according to John, his mother Mary, her sister, and Magdalene
were all at the foot of the cross. There also was the disciple
whom Jesus loved, and who in the three other Gospels had run
away. Before he died, Jesus committed his mother to the care
of this disciple as to a son, and he afterwards took her home.
The dogmatic purpose of this story is evident. Mary had not
been converted by her son during his life-time, and it was
important to bring her to the foot of the cross at his death, and
to place her in this close connection with one of his principal
disciples (Jo. xix. 25-27).</p>

<p>As to the last words of Jesus, there is an amount of divergence
which shows that no account can be regarded as trustworthy.
Mark and Matthew both relate that he called out,
"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" an exclamation which he may
really have uttered, or which, as coming from a prophetic
Psalm, may have seemed to them appropriate. Hereupon a
sponge of vinegar was offered him under the impression that
he was calling Elias, and with a loud cry he gave up the ghost.
In Luke he cries loudly, and then says, "Father, into thy
hands I commend my spirit." With these words (also from one
of the Psalms) upon his lips, he dies. In John he says, "I am
thirsty:" and after receiving some vinegar, adds, "It is finished;"
and bowing his head, gives up the ghost (Mk. xv. 34-37;
Mt. xxvii. 46-50; Lu. xxiii. 46; Jo. xix. 28-30).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268"> 268</span></p>

<p>With the death of Christ, and indeed immediately before it,
we pass from the region of mixed history and mythology into
that of pure mythology. With the exception of his burial, all
that follows has been deliberately invented. The wonders attendant
upon his closing hours belong in part to the typical
order of myths, and in part to an order peculiar to himself.
The darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour, the rending of
the temple veil, the earthquake, the rending of the rocks, are
altogether like the prodigies attending the decease of other
great men. The centurion's exclamation, "Truly this man was
just," or "Truly this man was the son of God" (it is differently
reported), is a myth belonging peculiarly to Christ, and
designed to exhibit the enforced confession of his greatness by
an incredulous Roman. In Matthew, where the more modest
narratives of Mark and Luke are greatly improved upon by additional
details, it is further added that many bodies of saints
arose, and after the resurrection appeared to many in Jerusalem
(Mk. xv. 33-39; Mt. xxvii. 45, and 51-54; Lu. xxiii. 44-47).</p>

<p>John, who knows nothing whatever of the darkness, the
accident to the temple veil, the revival of the saints, or the
centurion's exclamation, has a myth of his own constructed for
the especial purpose of fulfilling certain prophecies. The next
day being a festival, the Jews, he says, were anxious that the
bodies should not remain on the crosses. They therefore requested
Pilate to break their legs and remove them. He ordered
this to be done, and the legs of the two criminals were broken,
but not those of Jesus, who was already dead; one of the soldiers,
however, pierced his side, from which blood and water
gushed out. The writer adds a strong asseveration of his
veracity, but immediately betrays himself by letting out that in
relating the omission to break the legs of Jesus he was comparing
him to the Paschal lamb, of whom not a bone was to
be broken; while in telling of the soldier who pierced his side,
he was thinking of a phrase in Zechariah: "They shall look
upon me whom they have pierced" (Zech. xii. 10; Jo. xix. 31-37).</p>

<p>The burial of the body took place quietly. Joseph of Arimathæa,
a secret admirer of Jesus, placed it in a new sepulchre
of his own. With him John associates a character who exists
only in his Gospel, Nicodemus, and whom he introduces here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269"> 269</span>
as taking some part in the interment. To the circumstance of
the burial in the rock sepulchre, Matthew adds an audacious
fiction of his own; namely, that the chief priests, remembering
Christ's prediction that he should rise on the third day, obtained
leave to seal the stone of the tomb and keep it watched, lest
the disciples should take the body by night and pretend that
he was risen (Mk. xv. 42-47; Mt. xxvii. 57-66; Lu. xxiii. 50-56;
Jo. xix. 38-42).</p>

<p>Certainly if the Evangelist had meant to convey the impression
that no human means could prevent the resurrection of
Christ, he would have been perfectly right. An actual body
was not necessary for the purpose. For the legends appertaining
to the resurrection belong to a region in which imagination,
unhampered by the controlling influence of historical fact,
has been permitted the freest play. Of the appearances of Jesus
after his death we have accounts by no less than seven different
hands, each story being distinct from, though not always
inconsistent with, the other six. Let us begin with what is
probably the oldest of all, containing but a germ of the rest;
the first eight verses of the last chapter of Mark. There we are
told that on the day after the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Mary
James's mother, and Salome went to the sepulchre at sunrise.
They found it empty, the stone having been rolled away. A
young man in white clothes was sitting in it. He told them that
Jesus was risen, and desired them to tell the disciples that he
was going to Galilee, where they would see him. All that follows
in this Gospel is added by a later hand, and the very first
verse of the addition is plainly written in total disregard of
what has just preceded it. Observe then that <i>the simplest form
of the story of the resurrection contains no mention of any actual
appearance of Jesus whatever</i>, but merely an assertion that the
body was not in the tomb, and that a man, sitting inside it,
made certain statements to three women. To this the forger
has added that Jesus appeared first to Magdalene, whose account,
given to the disciples, was disbelieved by them; secondly,
to two disciples while walking, whose evidence was also disbelieved;
thirdly, to the eleven at dinner, to whom he addressed
a discourse (Mk. xvi.).</p>

<p>The writer of the first Gospel is much more elaborate. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270"> 270</span>
was a little embarrassed by the guards whom he had set to
watch the tomb, whom it was essential to find some convenient
method of getting out of the way. Like Mark, he takes the
two Marys (not Salome) to the sepulchre early on the first day
of the week; unlike Mark, he does not make them examine the
tomb and find it deserted. On the contrary, there is an earthquake
(the author is rather fond of these natural convulsions),
and an angel with a face like lightning, clothed in the purest
white, descends. He rolls back the stone and sits upon it. His
appearance so terrifies the keepers that they become like
corpses. The angel tells the women that Jesus is risen, and
that they are to let the disciples know that he would go before
them to Galilee, where they would see him. As they are engaged
on this errand, Jesus himself appears and gives them a
similar injunction. The second appearance occurred before the
eleven disciples, who saw him at an appointed place in Galilee,
"but some doubted." Here Jesus addressed to them a parting
discourse, and this Gospel does not state how or when he quitted
them. The awkward circumstance of the presence of the
guards, who had certainly not testified to the angel's descent,
had still to be surmounted. This is accomplished by a ridiculous
story that they had been heavily bribed by the priests and
elders to say that the disciples had stolen the body while they
were asleep (Mt. xxviii).</p>

<p>Unlike either of the preceding writers, Luke conceives the
first appearance of the risen Christ to have been, not to the
women, but to two disciples. He does indeed relate that on the
morning of the first day of the week Magdalene, Mary, Joanna,
and other women went to the tomb, and found the stone rolled
away and the body gone. While they were wondering at this,
two men in shining garments stood by them, and told them
that he whom they sought was risen. They returned to report
to the apostles, to whom their words seemed as idle tales.
Peter, however, ran to the sepulchre to verify their statement,
and found only the clothes in it. Two of the disciples were
going that same day to Emmaus. While walking and talking,
a stranger joined them and entered into a conversation, in
which he expounded the prophecies relating to the Messiah.
They requested this man to remain with them for the night at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271"> 271</span>
the house where they were lodging. During supper he took
bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them; whereupon they
recognized him as Jesus, and he vanished from their eyes. On
returning to Jerusalem, they found the eleven and the rest
asserting that Christ was risen and had appeared to Peter. The
two wanderers related their experiences in their turn. While
the disciples were talking, Jesus himself appeared in their
midst, and said, "Peace unto you." Some skeptical doubts,
however, troubled them even now, for Jesus thought it necessary
to prove his actual carnality by showing his hands and
feet, as well as by eating some broiled fish and a piece of honeycomb.
After this he "opened their understanding," by an expository
discourse in reference to some of his own sayings and
to the Scriptures; concluding with an exhortation to remain at
Jerusalem till they were endowed with power from on high (Lu.
xxii. 1-49). This last passage is explained by the same author
in the Acts of the Apostles to refer to the descent of the Holy
Ghost upon the apostles, which in that work is much more definitely
promised by Jesus (Acts i. 5, 8). We also find in it an
important addition to the details furnished by the Gospel about
the resurrection; namely, that Jesus was seen by his disciples
for forty days after his physical death, during which time he
kept speaking to them about matters pertaining to the kingdom
of God (Acts i. 3).</p>

<p>Directly contradicting Mark and Matthew, John states that
Magdalene (no one else is mentioned) went to the sepulchre
while it was still dark (not at dawn or sunrise), and found the
stone taken away. Making no further inspection, she ran to
Peter and to the beloved disciple, saying that the body had
been abstracted. The two ran together to the place, and going
in, found the clothes lying in the tomb, whereupon the beloved
disciple "saw and believed," though what he believed is not
stated. Magdalene was standing outside; but after the two men
had concluded their examination she entered, and saw what they
had not seen—two angels, sitting one at each end of the place
where the body had been. These angels asked her why she was
weeping; she answered, because her Lord's body had been
taken. Turning round, she saw a man whom she at first took
for the gardener, but whom she soon recognized as Jesus. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272"> 272</span>
returned and informed the disciples that she had seen him.
The same day, in the evening, Jesus appeared to the disciples,
said, "Peace unto you," and showed them his hands and feet.
He then breathed the Holy Ghost into them, and gave them
authority to remit or retain sins. Thomas, who was not present
on this occasion, roundly refused to believe these facts unless
he himself could touch the marks of the nails, and put his
hand into the side. A week later Jesus again appeared, and
Thomas was now enabled to dispel his doubts by actual examination
of his person. To these three appearances, with which
the genuine Gospel closed, a later hand has added a fourth.
According to this new writer, a number of disciples were about
to fish on the lake of Tiberias, when Christ was observed standing
on the shore. The miraculous draught of fishes is introduced
here in a form slightly different from that which it has
in Luke. By acting on a direction from Jesus, the disciples
caught a vast number. He then bade them come and dine with
him, which they did. After dinner, he instructed Peter to feed
his flock, and hinted that the beloved disciple might possibly
live till his return in glory (Jo. xx., xxi.).</p>

<p>Completely different from any of these narratives is the
account of the resurrection contributed by Paul. It is somewhat
confused and difficult to understand. Christ, he says, rose on
the third day according to the Scriptures, and was seen by
Cephas; then by the twelve; after that by more than five hundred
brethren; after that by James; next by all the apostles;
and lastly by himself (1 Cor. xv. 3-8). It is to be noted that
since Paul does not say that Christ appeared <i>first</i> to Cephas, we
may if we please combine with this account one of those which
make him appear first to Magdalene, or to her and other
women. But even then the difficulties do not disappear. For
how could so notorious an event as the manifestation of Christ
to five hundred people be passed over <i>sub silentio</i> in all the Gospels
and in the Acts? And granting that Paul may by an oversight
have put "the twelve" for "the eleven," are we not compelled
to suppose that "all the apostles" are distinct from
"the twelve," and if so, who are they? What, again, are we
to think of the appearance to James, of which nothing is said
elsewhere? Above all, what are we to think of the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273"> 273</span>
the purely spiritual vision granted to Paul, which was not even
seen by his traveling companions, is placed by him exactly on
a level with all the other reappearances of Christ, the physical
reality of which so much trouble has been taken to prove?</p>

<p>Comparing now the several narratives of the resurrection with
one another, we find this general result. In Mark, Jesus is
said to have appeared three times:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To Mary Magdalene.</li>
<li>2. To two disciples.</li>
<li>3. To the disciples at meat.</li>
</ul>


<p>Two such appearances only are recorded in Matthew:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To the women.</li>
<li>2. To the eleven in Galilee.</li>
</ul>


<p>In Luke he appears:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To Cleopas and his companion.</li>
<li>2. To Peter.</li>
<li>3. To the eleven and others.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the two last chapters of John the appearances amount to
four:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To Mary Magdalene.</li>
<li>2. To the disciples without Thomas.</li>
<li>3. To the disciples with Thomas.</li>
<li>4. To several disciples on the Tiberias lake.</li>
</ul>


<p>Paul extends them to six:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To Peter.</li>
<li>2. To the twelve.</li>
<li>3. To more than 500.</li>
<li>4. To James.</li>
<li>5. To all the apostles.</li>
<li>6. To Paul.</li>
</ul>


<p>Upon this most momentous question, then, every one of the
Christian writers is at variance with every other. Nor is this all,
for two of the number bring the earthly career of Jesus to its
final close in a manner so extraordinary that we cannot even
imagine the occurrence of such an event, of necessity so notorious
and so impressive, to have been believed by the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274"> 274</span>
biographers, and yet to have been passed over by them without
a word of notice or allusion. Can it be for a moment supposed
that two out of the four Evangelists had heard of the ascension
of Christ—that the most wonderful termination of a wonderful
life—and either forgot to mention, or deliberately omitted it?
And may it not be assumed that Paul, when detailing the
several occasions on which Christ had been seen after his crucifixion,
must needs, had he known of it, have included this, perhaps
the most striking of all, in his list? In fact the ascension
rests entirely on the evidence of two witnesses, both of them
comparatively late ones, the forger of the last verses of Mark,
and the third Evangelist. Neither of them stand as near the
events described as the true author of Mark, as Matthew, or as
Paul, from no one of whom do we hear a word of the ascension.
Nor do even these two witnesses relate their story in the same
terms. The finisher of Mark merely tells us that after his parting
charge to the eleven, he was received into heaven and sat
at God's right hand; a statement couched in such general
terms as even to leave it doubtful whether there was any distinct
and visible ascension, or whether Jesus was merely taken
to heaven like any other virtuous man, though enjoying when
there a higher precedence (Mk. xvi. 19). Especially is this
doubt fostered by the fact that this Gospel, when speaking of
the witnesses to Christ's resurrection, never alludes to any of
the physical proofs of his actual existence so much dwelt upon
in Luke and the last chapter of John. Very much more definite
is the statement at the close of the third Gospel. There it is
related that Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany, where he
blessed them and that, in the very act of blessing, he was
parted from them and carried up into heaven (Lu. xxiv. 50, 51).
The same author subsequently composed the Acts of the Apostles,
and in the interim he had greatly improved upon his previous
conception of the ascension. When he came to write the
Acts, he was able to supply, what he had omitted before, the
last conversation of the master with the disciples he was about
to leave; he knows too that after the final words—no blessing
is mentioned here—he was taken up and received by a cloud;
that while the disciples were gazing up, two men in white—no
doubt the very couple who had been seen at the sepulchre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275"> 275</span>—
were perceived standing by them, and that these celestial visitors
told them that Jesus would return from heaven in the
same way in which he had gone to it (Acts i. 9-11). Unhappy
Galileans! little could they have dreamt for how many centuries
after that day their successors would watch and wait,
watching and waiting in vain, for the fulfillment of that consoling
prophecy.</p>

<p>Casting a retrospective glance at the stories of the Resurrection
and the Ascension, we may perhaps discern at least a psychological
explanation of their origin and of the currency they
obtained. Whatever other qualities Jesus may have possessed
or lacked, there can be no question that he had one—that of
inspiring in others a strong attachment to himself. He had in
his brief career surrounded himself with devoted disciples; and
he was taken from their midst in the full bloom of his powers
by a violent and early death. Now there are some who have
been taught by the bitter experience of their lives how difficult,
nay, how impossible it is to realize in imagination the fact that
a beloved companion is in truth gone from them forever. More
especially will this mental difficulty be felt when he whom
death has parted from our sides is young, vigorous, full of
promise; when the infinite stillness of eternal rest has succeeded
almost without a break upon the joyous activity of a well-spent
life; when the being who is now no more was but a moment
ago the moving spirit of a household, or the honored teacher
of a band of friends who were linked together by his
presence.</p>

<p>Where the association has been close and constant; where
we have been accustomed to share our thoughts and to impart
our feelings; where, therefore, we have habitually entwined not
only our present lives, but our hopes and wishes for the future
around the personality of the dead, this refusal of the mind to
comprehend its loss is strongest of all. Emotion enters then
upon a strange conflict with Reason. Reason may tell us but
too distinctly that all hope of the return of the beloved one to
life is vain and foolish. But Emotion speaks to us in another
language. Well nigh does it prevent us from believing even
the ghastly realities which our unhappy eyes have been compelled
to witness. Deep within us there arises the craving for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276"> 276</span>
the presence of our friend, and with it the irrepressible thought
that he may even yet come back to those who can scarcely bear
to live without him. Were these inevitable longings not to be
checked by a clear perception that they originate in our own
broken hearts, we should fancy that we saw the figure of the
departed and heard his voice. In that case a resurrection would
have taken place for us, and for those who believed our tale.
So far from the reappearance of the well-known form seeming
to be strange, it is its failure to reappear that is strange to us
in these times of sorrow. We fondly conceive that in some way
the dead must still exist; and if so, can one, who was so tender
before, listen to our cry of pain and refuse to come? can one,
who soothed us in the lesser troubles of our lives, look on
while we are suffering the greatest agony of all and fail to
comfort? It cannot be. Imagination declines to picture the
long future of solitude that lies before us. We cannot understand
that we shall never again listen to the tones of the familiar
voice; never feel the touch of the gentle hand; never be
encouraged by the warm embrace that tells us we are loved, or
find a refuge from miserable thoughts and the vexations of the
world in the affectionate and ever-open heart. All this is too
hard for us. We long for a resurrection; we should believe in
it if we could; we do believe in it in sleep, when our feelings
are free to roam at pleasure, unrestrained by the chilling presence
of the material world. In dreams the old life is repeated
again and again. Sometimes the lost one is beside us as of old,
and we are quite untroubled by the thought of parting. Sometimes
there is a strange and confusing consciousness that the
great calamity has happened, or has been thought to happen,
but that now we are again together, and that a new life has
succeeded upon death. Or the dream takes a less definite form.
We are united now; but along with our happiness in the union
there is an oppressive sense of some mysterious terror clouding
our enjoyment. We are afraid that it is an unsubstantial,
shadowy being that is with us; the least touch may dissipate
its uncertain existence; the slightest illness may extinguish its
feeble breath. Granting only a strong emotion and a lively
phantasy, we may comprehend at once how, in many lands, to
many mourners, the images of their dreams may also become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277"> 277</span>
the visions of their waking hours. They see him again; they
know that he is not gone; he is beside them still.</p>

<p>But for us, who live in a calmer age, and see with scientific
eyes, there is no such comfort. Not to us can the bodily forms
of those who have gone before us to the grave appear again
in all the loveliness of life. In the first shock of our bereavement
we may indeed indulge in some such visionary hope; but
as day after day passes by and leaves us in a solitude that does
but deepen with the lapse of time, we learn to understand only
too well that we are bereft forever. Hope gradually dwindling
to a fainter and fainter remnant, is crushed at last by the miserable
certainty of profound despair. Yet even then, the mind of
man refuses to accept its fate. The scene of the reunion, which
we cannot but so ardently desire, is postponed to another season
and to a better world. Many are they to whom this final hope
is an enduring consolation, but if even that should fail us in
the hour of darkness, as the more primitive and simpler hope
failed before it; if here again emotion is reluctantly compelled
to yield to reason; then there is still one refuge in despondency,
and a refuge of which we can never be deprived. It is
the thought that death, so cruel now, will one day visit us with
a kinder touch; and that the tomb, which already holds the
nearest and the dearest within its grasp, will open to receive us
also in our turn to its everlasting peace.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 3.</span>—<i>The Ideal Jesus.</i></h5>

<p>The Gospel attributed by the current legend to St. John differs
from the other three Gospels in almost every respect in
which difference is possible. The events recorded are different.
The order of events is different. The conversations of Jesus
are different. His sermons are different. His opinions are different.
The theories of the writer about him are different.
Were it not for the name and a few leading incidents, we should
be compelled to say that the subject of the biography himself
is different. A more conspicuous unlikeness than that of the
synoptical to the Johannine Jesus it is not easy to conceive in
two narratives which depict the same hero. In the synoptical
Gospels Jesus is plain, direct, easy of comprehension, and fond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278"> 278</span>
of illustrating his meaning by short and simple parables. In
John he is obscure, mystical, symbolic, and of his favorite
method of teaching by parables there is not a trace. Both descriptions
cannot be true. It would be monstrous to suppose
either that the synoptical Gospels omitted some of his most extraordinary
miracles and some of his most remarkable discourses,
or that the Gospel of John passed over in silence the
whole of that side of his character which is portrayed in the
ethical maxims, the parables, and the exhortations of its predecessors.
Were it so, none of the four could be accepted as
other than an extremely one-sided and imperfect biography, and
each of them is plainly regarded by its author as complete
within itself. None of them refers to extraneous sources to
supplement its own deficiencies. The concluding verse of the
fourth Gospel does indeed allude to many unrecorded actions of
Jesus, which, if they were all written, would fill more books
than the world could contain. But, not to rely on the fact that
the last chapter is spurious, these words contain no intimation
that a mode of teaching completely different from that here
recorded was ever employed by Jesus. And this is the point in
which John's narrative is peculiar. Again, to turn to the Synoptics,
there is no shadow of an intimation in them that, between
the last supper and arrest, Jesus addressed to his disciples a
long and remarkable discourse, full of the most interesting revelations.
Can we suppose that they could have forgotten it, delivered
as it was at such a moment as this, the very last before
their master's condemnation at which he was able to speak to
them? Such a supposition is utterly untenable. The two traditions
embodied in these versions of his life do not therefore, as
some learned men—Ewald, for example—have supposed, supplement,
but exclude one another.</p>

<p>Let us enter into detail into some of the peculiar characteristics
of the Jesus of John. In the first place, we may note
that his miracles are altogether new. One of them at least is
so astounding that no biographer who had heard of it could
have passed it by. The raising of Lazarus is the greatest feat
that Jesus ever performed. In other cases he brought persons
who were supposed to be just dead to life, but skeptical Jews
might have suspected that they had never in reality died at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279"> 279</span>
Ample precautions against such cavils were taken in the case
of Lazarus. This man lived at Bethany, and his sisters, Mary
and Martha, were devoted admirers of Jesus. These women
sent word to Jesus, who had retired "beyond Jordan," to say
that their brother was ill. He replied that this illness was for
the glory of God. After he had heard of it he remained two
days in the same place. Then, disregarding the dissuasions of
the disciples, who reminded him that the Jews had recently
sought to stone him, he proceeded towards Judea. He informed
them in that obscure manner which he almost invariably affects
in this Gospel, that Lazarus was asleep; but on their misunderstanding
him, consented to speak plainly and say that he was
dead. He added that for their sakes he was glad he had not
been there, in order that they might believe—even the disciples'
faith being apparently still in need of confirmation. On
reaching Bethany, he found that Lazarus had been buried four
days. Martha, who came to meet him, observed that had he
been there, her brother would not have died, and that even now
whatever he asked of God would be given. Jesus told her that
her brother would rise again; a saying which she interpreted
as referring to the general resurrection; but he replied that
whoever believed in him would never die, and required of her
an explicit declaration of her faith in this dogma. Martha
evaded the inquiry by a profession of her conviction that he
was the Christ and went to summon Mary. She too remarked
that if he had been there Lazarus would not have died. Distressed
by her distress, Jesus himself wept. Going to the grave,
he ordered the stone which covered it to be removed, in spite
of Martha's objection that putrefaction had set in. A curious
scene followed. "Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, 'Father, I
thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I know that thou
hearest me always, but because of the people which stand by I
said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.'" We
must suppose these last words to have been spoken <i>sotto voce</i>,
for "the people which stood by" would have been little likely
to believe in him had they known that the thanksgiving to God
was a mere pious pretence, offered up for the purpose of impressing
their imaginations by the event that was to follow.
Knowing that his father always heard him, he certainly had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280"> 280</span>
occasion to thank him on this one occasion; if indeed he could
properly be thanked at all for taking the necessary measures
to ensure the credit of his own son, in whom he desired mankind
to believe, and who is over and over again described as
one with himself. This is perhaps the only instance in any of
the Gospels in which something like hypocrisy is ascribed to
Jesus; in which he is represented as consciously acting a part
for the benefit of the bystanders, and speaking simply with a
view to effect. Happily for his reputation we are not obliged
to believe in the accuracy of his biographer. After this he called
loudly, "Lazarus, come forth." The dead man accordingly
arose, and came forth from the tomb clad in his grave-clothes
(Jo. xi. 1-46). His restoration to life was permanent, for we find
him afterwards among the guests at a supper to which Jesus
was invited (Jo. xii. 2).</p>

<p>Another singular miracle to which there is no allusion in any
other Gospel is that which is here declared to be the first; the
conversion of water into wine. Jesus was at a wedding in Cana
of Galilee, and when the wine provided for the entertainment
had all been consumed, his mother informed him of the state
of things. He gave her a repelling answer; but she told the
servants to do what he bade them. He then ordered six waterpots
to be filled with water, and the contents to be drawn. It
was found that they contained wine of a superior quality to
that at first provided (Jo. ii. 1-11).</p>

<p>The second miracle according to John is not unlike some of
those recorded elsewhere. It consisted in the cure by a mere
word, without visiting the place, of a nobleman's son who was
on the point of death. This time also Jesus was at Cana,
though the patient lay at Capernaum (Jo. iii. 46-54). Another
cure was wrought at the pool of Bethesda, the healing virtues
of which are known only to this Gospel. A man who had long
been lying on its steps, too infirm to descend at the proper
moment, was enjoined to rise and walk, which he did (Jo. v.
1-9). It is singular that although "a great multitude of impotent
folk" were waiting at the pool, many of whom must
needs have been kept long, since only one could be cured each
time the water was troubled, this man alone was selected for the
object of a miracle. Why were not all of them healed at once?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281"> 281</span></p>

<p>Not only are the most wonderful proofs of Christ's divinity
contained in this Gospel unknown to the rest, but its <i>dramatis
personæ</i> are in several respects altogether novel. Nathanael,
whose difficulties about thinking that any good thing can come
from Nazareth are overcome in a conversation with Jesus (Jo. i.
45-51); Nicodemus, the secret adherent who came by night and
received instruction in the doctrine of regeneration (Jo. iii. 1-21),
who at a later period supported him against the attacks of the
Pharisees (Jo. vii. 51), and lastly brought spices to his interment
(Jo. xix. 39); Lazarus, brother of Mary and Martha, who owed
him his life (Jo. xi. 44; xii. 2); the woman of Sâmaria, to whom
an important prophecy was made, and whose past life he knew
by intuition (Jo. iv. 1-30); are all new personages, and they hold
no mean place in the story. The immediate attendants on his
person are no doubt the same; but the representation that
there was one disciple "whom Jesus loved" above the rest,
and to whom a greater intimacy was permitted (Jo. xiii. 23), is
uncountenanced by anything in the other Gospels; and indicates
a fixed purpose of exalting the apostle John above his compeers.</p>

<p>While the scene, the persons, and the plot are thus diverse,
the style of the principal actor is in striking contrast to that
which he employs elsewhere. Its most conspicuous characteristic
is the continual recurrence to symbols. It is true
that in the other Gospels Jesus frequently exchanges the direct
explanation of his views for the indirect method of illustration.
But an illustration serves to clear up the meaning of a speaker,
a symbol to disguise it. Illustrations cast light upon the principal
thesis; symbols merely darken it. And this is the difference
between the synoptical and the Johannine Jesus. The one
is anxious to be understood; the other, in appearance at least,
is seeking to perplex. Hence the exchange of the parable for
the symbol. The number of such symbols in John is considerable.
Jesus is continually inventing new ones. Near the
beginning of the Gospel, he explains to Nicodemus that it is
needful to be born again; a statement by which Nicodemus
is considerably perplexed (Jo. iii. 3, 4). But his symbols are
more generally applied to himself or his relations to the
Father. He is the bread of life or the bread of God (Jo. vi.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282"> 282</span>
33-48); again, he is the living water (Jo. iv. 10), or he gives a water
which prevents all future thirst (Jo. iv. 14); he is the true vine,
his Father the husbandman, and his disciples the branches (Jo.
xv. 1-5); elsewhere he is both the good shepherd and the door
by which the sheep enter the fold (Jo. x. 7-16); he is the way,
the truth, and the life (Jo. xiv. 6); he is the light that came
into the world (Jo. xii. 46; iii. 19); or he is the Resurrection
and the Life (Jo. xi. 25). John the Baptist, also, unlike the
John of the other Gospels, adopts the same manner. Christ is
spoken of by him as the Lamb of God, which takes away the
sins of the world (Jo. i. 29); or as the Bridegroom whose voice
he rejoiced to hear, while he himself was but the Bridegroom's
friend (Jo. iii. 29). Sometimes "the Jews," as they are termed
in this Gospel, are puzzled by the enigmatical style of Jesus,
the sense of which they cannot unriddle. Thus, when he tells
them that if they destroy the temple he will rebuild it in three
days, they are naturally unable to perceive that he is speaking of
the temple of his body (Jo. ii. 19-21). They murmured because he
spoke of himself as the Bread that came down from heaven, nor
was any explanation offered them beyond a reiteration of the
same statement (Jo. vi. 41-51). Not only the Jews, but also many
of his own partisans, were hopelessly perplexed by the statement
that no one could have life in him who did not eat his flesh
and drink his blood (Jo. vi. 53, 60), a statement which differs
materially from that made at the passover (in the other Gospels),
where the bread and wine were actually offered as signs
of his flesh and blood, and the apostles alone (who were present)
were required to receive them. At other times he confused
them by mysterious intimations that he was going somewhere
whither they could not come, and that they should seek him
and be unable to find him (Jo. vii. 33-36; viii. 21, 22). On one
occasion, his auditors were unable to comprehend his assertion
that he must be lifted up, and requested him to explain it.
The only reply was another enigma, namely, that the light was
with them but a little while, and that they should believe in it
while they had it (Jo. xii. 32-36). To such language they might
well have retorted, that what they had from him was not light,
but a twilight in which no object could be distinctly seen, and
which never advanced towards clear daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283"> 283</span></p>

<p>Closely connected with this tendency to speak in obscure
images was his predilection for argument with the Jews on
abstruse theological topics. In the other Gospels he teaches the
people who surround him, and the subject of his teaching is generally
the rules of moral conduct; comparatively seldom theology.
In John he does not so much teach as dispute, and the
subject of the dispute is not morals—a field he scarcely ever
enters—but his personal pretensions. Upon these he carries on
a continual wrangle, supporting his claims by his peculiar
views of the divine nature and of his relation to it (Jo. v. 16-47;
vi. 41-59; vii. 14-36; viii. 12-29; ix. 39-41; x. 19-37). In the same
spirit the blind man whom he cures enters into a discussion with
the Pharisees on the character of him who had restored his sight
(Jo. ix. 24-34). The Jews are depicted as continually occupied
about this question. Even their own officers receive from
them a reproof for making a laudatory remark about him (Jo.
vii. 47, 48), while Nicodemus, who interposes in arrest of judgment,
is sharply asked whether he also is of Galilee (Jo. vii.
51-52).</p>

<p>The very best instruction of Jesus is not given, as in the
other Gospels, to a multitude, but is reserved for a select circle
of his own followers. It is in the 14th, 15th, and 16th chapters
that he rises to the sublimest heights of his doctrine, and the
whole of this remarkable discourse is delivered to the disciples
after Judas has left the supper-table in order to betray him.
The substance of his teaching is no less peculiar than its occasions.
The writer conceives of him as holding an altogether
singular relation to the Father, and that relation he represents
his Christ as continually expounding and insisting upon as of
vital moment. The Evangelist himself begins his work by a
concise statement of his doctrine on this point. The Logos, he
says, was with God in the beginning; the Logos was God. All
things were made by it, and nothing was made without it. In
it was life, and the life was the light of men. This Light came
into the world, but the world did not know him. Even his
own, whoever these may have been, did not receive him. To
those who did receive him, he gave power to become the sons
of God; and these were born, not of blood, nor of the will of
the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. The Logos was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284"> 284</span>
made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, as
of the only-begotten of the Father (Jo. i. 1-14).</p>

<p>The language of Christ is duly adjusted to this very speculative
theory. Thus, he scandalizes the Jews by the bold assertion
that he and his Father are one; and adds to their horror
by further maintaining that he is in the Father, and the Father
in him (Jo. x. 30, 38). Elsewhere, Philip is required to believe in
the same truth. In reply to his ignorant request that he may
be shown the Father, he is told that seeing Jesus is equivalent
to seeing the Father. Moreover, the Father who dwells in
Christ performs the works which are apparently done by Christ
alone (Jo. xiv. 9-11). The disciples, too, are included in this
mystic unity, for they are in Jesus in the same sense in which
he is in God (Jo. xiv. 20; xvii. 21, 23). His Father, nevertheless,
is greater than himself (Jo. xiv. 28). Jesus has been glorified
with the Father before the world existed, and looks forward to
a return to that glory. He wishes that those who have been
given him on earth may be with him to behold the glory which
God, who loved him before the foundation of the world, has
given him. That glory he has given them, and they are to be
one, even as he and his Father are one; he in them, and God
in him (Jo. xvii. 5, 22-24).</p>

<p>After these preliminary observations, we need not dwell long
on the historical incidents of the Gospel, of which there are
but few. The meeting of Jesus with Andrew and Simon, and
his reception of Nathanael, related in the first chapter, have
already been noticed. It only remains to be said, that Nathanael
was deceived by a prophecy which was not fulfilled; for at
the end of the interview, Jesus, referring to his amazement
that he had been discovered under the fig-tree, which had quite
put him off his balance, tells him that he shall see greater
things than these, and especially mentions among them the
opening of the heavens and the descent of angels upon the Son
of man. Nathanael never saw anything of the kind (Jo. i. 35-51).</p>

<p>The conversion of water into wine follows next. A peculiarity
in the notions of this writer is evinced by the assertion that
his mother and brothers went with him to Capernaum, for his
family do not accompany him, according to any other statement,
while here his mother not only is with him, but is aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285"> 285</span>
that he is able to work a miracle (Jo. ii. 1-12). Jesus, after visiting
Capernaum, proceeded for the passover to Jerusalem,
where it is said that many believed in him because of his miracles.
His expulsion of the money-changers, however, brought
him into collision with the authorities of his nation, who asked
him for a sign; a question to which he replied by the undertaking
to rebuild the temple, if destroyed, in three days (Jo. ii.
13-25). But one of the Jewish rulers, named Nicodemus, was
disposed to believe in his pretensions. This man came to him
by night, and heard from him a long theological disquisition
(Jo. iii. 1-21). Jesus then went into Judea, and remained there
with his disciples baptizing his converts. John the Baptist is
made to bear an emphatic testimony to his superiority (Jo. iii.
22-36). A visit to Sâmaria is the occasion for an interesting dialogue
with a Sâmaritan woman who had come to draw water at
a well; and her report leads the inhabitants to come out and
see the prophet by whom she had been so much impressed.</p>

<p>This incident is reproduced with curious fidelity in a Buddhist
story. Ananda, one of Sakyamuni's disciples, met with a Matangi
woman, one of a degraded caste, who was drawing water,
and asked her to give him some of it to drink. Just as the
Sâmaritan wondered that Jesus, a Jew, should ask drink of her,
one of a nation with whom the Jews had no dealings, so this
young Matangi girl warned Ananda of her caste, which rendered
it unlawful for her to approach a monk. And as Jesus
nevertheless continued to converse with the woman, so Ananda
did not shrink from this outcast damsel. "I do not ask thee,
my sister," he replied, "either thy caste or thy family; I only
ask thee for water, if thou canst give me some." The Buddha
himself, to whom the Matangi girl afterwards presented herself,
treated her with equal kindness. He contrived to divert the
profane love she had conceived for Ananda into a holy love of
religion; much as Jesus led the Sâmaritan from the thought of
her five husbands, and of him who was not her husband, to the
conception of the universal Father who was to be worshiped
"in spirit and in truth." And as the disciples "marveled"
that Jesus should have conversed with this member of a despised
race, so the respectable Brahmins and householders who
adhered to Buddhism were scandalized to learn that the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286"> 286</span>
Matangi had been admitted to the order of mendicants (Jo. iv.
1-42; H. B. I., pp. 205, 206).</p>

<p>After two days spent at Sâmaria Jesus went on to Galilee,
where he healed the nobleman's sons (Jo. iv. 43-54). Having
returned to Jerusalem for another feast, he cured the impotent
man on the Sabbath, which endangered his life at the hands of
the indignant Jews, and led him to deliver a long vindication
(Jo. v). The feeding of the five thousand was followed by an
attempt to make him king, from which he prudently escaped.
The disciples took ship to go to Capernaum, and Jesus joined
them by walking on the water. On the ensuing day he preached
to the people who followed him, and shocked even some of the
disciples by the loftiness of the claims he advanced. Many of
them are said to have left him at this time (Jo. vi).</p>

<p>A singular proceeding is now mentioned. Urged by his
brothers, who were still incredulous, to go to Jerusalem for the
feast of tabernacles, he declined on the ground that his time
was not yet come. When they were gone he himself went also,
though secretly (Jo. vii. 1-10). There is no reason assigned for
this little stratagem, and he soon emerged from his incognito
and taught openly in the temple. The public mind was much
divided about his character, some maintaining him to be Christ,
others contending that Christ could only come from the seed of
David and the town of Bethlehem. An attempt to arrest him
failed, owing to the impression he made upon the police (Jo.
vii. 11-53). A discussion with the Jews was terminated by their
taking up stones to throw at him, a peril from which he escaped
apparently by miracle (Jo. viii. 12-59; verses 1-11 are spurious).
Further offense was given by the restoration of a blind man's
sight on the Sabbath (Jo. ix). A discourse on his title to authority
provoked divisions, and at the feast of the dedication he
was plainly asked whether he was the Christ. His answer
again led to an attempt to stone him, from which he escaped
to the place beyond Jordan where John had formerly baptized
(Jo. x). The raising of Lazarus and the anointing by Mary are
the next events recorded (Jo. xi. 1-xii. 9). The passover followed
six days after the latter incident, and his preaching at this festival
was interrupted in a singular manner. Jesus had used the
words, "Father, glorify thy name!" whereupon a voice was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287"> 287</span>
heard from heaven, saying, "I both have glorified it, and will
glorify it again." Thereupon Jesus observed that this voice
came not for his sake, but for that of the bystanders. It seems,
however, to have produced but little effect upon them, for a few
verses later we find a complaint that, in spite of his many miracles,
they did not believe in him (Jo. xii. 12-50). The last supper
with the disciples was immediately succeeded by a parting
discourse of much beauty, conceived in an elevated tone; and
his last moments of freedom were occupied in a prayer of which
the pathos has been rarely equaled (Jo. xiii.-xvii).</p>

<p>The remainder of his career—his trial, execution, and alleged
resurrection—have been fully treated in another place.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 4.</span>—<i>What did the Jews think of him?</i></h5>

<p>Victorious over Jesus Christ at the moment, the Jewish
nation have, from an early period in Christian history, been
subject in their turn to his disciples. Their polity—crushed
under the iron heel of Vespasian, scattered to the winds by
Hadrian—vanished from existence not long after it had successfully
put down the founder of the new faith. Their religion,
tolerated by the heathen Romans only under humiliating and
galling conditions, persecuted almost to death by the Christians,
suffered until modern times an oppression so terrible and so
cruel, that but for the deep and unshakeable attachment of its
adherents, it could never have survived its perils. Hence the
course of events has been such that this unhappy nation has
never until quite recently enjoyed the freedom necessary to
present their case in the matter of Jesus the son of Joseph;
while the gradual decay of the rancor formerly felt against them,
at the same time that it gives them liberty, renders it less important
for them to come forward in what would still be an
unpopular cause. Thus it happens that one side only in the
controversy, that of the Christians, has been adequately heard.
They certainly have not shrunk from the presentation of their
views. Every epithet that scorn, hatred, or indignation could
suggest has been heaped upon the generation of Jews who were
the immediate instigators of the execution of Jesus, while all
the subsequent miseries of their race have been regarded—by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288"> 288</span>
the party which delighted to inflict them—as exhibitions of the
divine vengeance against that one criminal act. Nor have even
freethinkers shrunk from condemning the Jews as guilty of
gross and unpardonable persecution, and that towards one who,
if they do not think him a God, nevertheless appears to them
singularly free from blame. On the one side, according to the
prevailing conception, stands the innocent victim; on the other
the bloodthirsty Jewish people. All good is with the one; all
evil with the other. It is supposed that only their hard-heartedness,
their aversion to the pure doctrine of the Redeemer,
their determination to shut their eyes to the light and their
ears to the words of truth, could have led them to the commission
of so great a crime.</p>

<p>Whether or not this theory be true, it at least suffers from
the vice of having been adopted without due examination. An
opinion can rest on no solid basis unless its opposite has been
duly supported by competent defenders. Now in the present
instance this has not happened. Owing to the causes mentioned
above, the Christian view has been practically uncontested, and
writer after writer has taken it up and repeated it in the unreflecting
way in which we all of us repeat assertions about which
there is no dispute. Yet a very little consideration will show
that so simple an explanation of the transaction has at least no
<i>a priori</i> probability in its favor. That a whole nation should
be completely in the wrong, and a few individuals only in the
right, is a supposition which can be accepted only on the most
convincing evidence. And in order even to justify our entertaining
it for a moment, we must be in possession of a report
of the circumstances of the case from the advocates of the nation,
as well as from the advocates of the individuals who suffered
by its action. A one-sided statement from the partizans
of a convicted person can never be sufficient to enable us to
pronounce a conclusive verdict against his judges. The most
ordinary rules of fairness prohibit this. Yet this is what is
commonly done. No account whatever of the trial of Jesus has
reached us from the side of the prosecution. Josephus, who
might have enlightened us, is silent. On the other hand, the
side of the defense has furnished us with its own version of
what passed, and from the imperfect materials thus supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289"> 289</span>
we must endeavor to discriminate between the two as best we
can. To do this justly, we must bear in mind, that even though
the charges produced against Jesus should not appear to justify
the indignation of his accusers, it is at least unlikely that that
indignation was altogether without reasonable cause. And painful
as it may be to be compelled to think that Jesus was in the
wrong, it would surely—had not long habit perverted our natural
sentiments—be quite as painful to believe that a large
multitude of men, impelled by mere malignity against a virtuous citizen,
had conspired to put him to death on charges which
were absolutely groundless. The honor of an heroic, and above
all, of a deeply religious people, is here at stake. It is no light
matter to deal in wholesale accusations of judicial murder
against them. It would surely be a happier solution if it could
be shown that the individual condemned was not absolutely
guiltless. But possibly we may be able to elude either alternative.
Just as, according to the able reasoning of Grote, the upright
character of Socrates may be compatible with a sense of
justice on the part of the Athenians who condemned him to
death, so it is conceivable that the innocence of Jesus may consist
with the fact that the Jews who caused him to be crucified
were not altogether without excuse.</p>

<p>An examination of this question must be conducted with a
careful regard to the hereditary feelings of orthodox Hebrews
in matters of religion; with an attention to the conceptions
they had formed of holiness, and consequently of blasphemy,
its negation; with a desire to do justice if possible to the very
prejudices that clouded their vision, and to realize the intensity
of the sentiment that ruled their national life and bound them
to uphold their law in all its severe integrity. We must
remember that the Jews were above all things monotheists.
Ever since, after the captivity, they had put away every remnant
of idolatry, they had clung to the unity and majesty of
Jehovah with a stern tenacity which no alluring temptations,
no extremity of suffering, had been able to break. If they were
now ready to persecute for this faith, they had at least shown
themselves able—they soon showed themselves able again—to
bear persecution for its sake. Their law, with its monotheistic
dogmas and its practical injunctions, was to them supremely holy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290"> 290</span>
Any attempt to infringe its precepts, or to question its authority,
excited their utmost horror. To set up any other object
of worship than that which it recognized, to teach any other
faith than that which rested on this foundation, was blasphemy
in their eyes. The happiness, nay, the very existence, of the
nation was bound up with its strict observance. This may have
been a delusion, but it was one for which the existing generation
was not responsible. It had been handed down from their
ancestors, and had reached them with all the sanctity of venerable
age. If it were a delusion, it was one which the compilers
of the Pentateuch; which Josiah, with his reforming measures;
which Ezra, with his purifying zeal; which the prophets
and priests of olden times who had fought and labored for the
religion of Jehovah, had mainly fostered. They had succeeded
but too well in impressing upon the mind of the nation the
profound conviction that, in order to ensure the favor of God,
they must maintain every iota of the revealed truth they had
received, and that his anger would surely follow if they suffered
it to be in the smallest degree corrupted or treated with neglect.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the utmost efforts of the people to guard the
purity of the faith had been rewarded hitherto with little but
misery. Their exemption from troubles did not last long after
the rebuilding of the temple. A prey now to the Seleucidæ,
now to the Ptolemies, their native land the scene of incessant
warfare, they enjoyed under the Asmonean kings but a brief
period of independence and good government. Their polity
received a rude shock from the capture of Jerusalem by Pompey;
maintained but a shadow of freedom under the tyranny of
Herod; and fell at last—some time before the public appearance
of Christ—under the direct administration of the unsympathetic
Romans. A more intolerable fate could hardly be
imagined. The Romans had no tenderness for their feelings, no
commiseration for their scruples, no comprehension of their
peculiar practices. Hence constant collision between the governors
and the governed. It is needless to enter in detail upon
the miserable struggles between those who were strong in the
material force and those who were strong in the force of conscience.
Suffice it to say, that provocation on provocation was inflicted
on the Jews, until at length the inevitable rebellion came,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291"> 291</span>
to be terminated by the not less inevitable suppression with its
attendant cruelties. But in the time of Jesus the crisis had not
yet come. All things were in a state of the utmost tension. It
was of the highest importance to the people, and their authorities
were well aware of it, that there should be nothing done that
could excite the anger of their rulers. The Romans knew, of
course, that no loyalty was felt towards them in Palestine.
And the least indication of resistance was enough to provoke
them to the severest measures. All that remained of independence
to the Jews—the freedom to worship in their own way;
their national unity; their possession of the temple; their very
lives—depended on their success in conciliating the favor of
the procurator who happened to be set over them. The assertion
by any one of rights that might appear to clash with those
of Rome, even the foolish desire of the populace to honor some
one who did not pretend to them, were fraught with the utmost
danger. It was necessary for the rulers to prove that they did
not countenance the least indication of a wish to set up a rival
power.</p>

<p>Their task was more difficult because the people were continually
looking for some great national hero who should redeem
them from their subjection. The conception of the "Messiah,"
the Anointed One, the King or High Priest who should
restore, and much more than restore, the ancient glory of their
nation, who should lead them to victory over their enemies and
then reign over them in peace, was ineradicably imbedded in
their minds. Consequently they were only too ready—especially
in those days of overstrung nerves and feverish agitation under
a hateful rule—to welcome any one who held out the chance
of deliverance. The risk was not imaginary. Prophets and
Messiahs, if they were not successful, could do nothing but
harm. Theudas, a leader who did not even claim Messiahship,
had involved his followers in destruction. Bar-cochab, who at a
later time was received by many as the Messiah, brought upon
his countrymen not only enormous slaughter, but even the crowning
misfortune of expulsion from Jerusalem. Now, although the
high priests and elders no doubt shared the popular expectation
of a Messiah, they were bound as prudent men to test the pretensions
of those who put themselves forward in that character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292"> 292</span>
and if they were imperiling the public peace, to put a stop to
their careers. It was not for them, the appointed guides of the
people, to be carried away by every breath of popular enthusiasm.
They would have been wholly unworthy of their position
had they permitted floating reports of miracles and marvels, or
the applauding clamor of admirers, to impose upon their judgment.
Calmly, and after examination of the facts, it was their
duty to decide.</p>

<p>Jesus had professed to be the Messiah. So much is undisputed.
Could his title be admitted? Now, in the first place, it
was the central conception of the Messianic office that its
holder should exercise temporal power. He was not expected
to be a teacher of religious doctrines, for this was not what was
required. The code of theological truth was, so far as the Jews
were aware, completed. The Revelation they possessed never
hinted, from beginning to end, that it was imperfect in any of
its parts, or that it needed a supplementary Revelation to fill
up the void which it contained. Whatever Christians, instructed
by the gospel, may have thought in subsequent ages, the believers
in the Hebrew Bible neither had ascertained, nor possibly
could ascertain, that Jehovah intended to send his Son on
earth to enlighten them on questions appertaining to their
religious belief. This they thought had long been settled, and
he who tried either to take anything from it or add anything to
it was in their eyes an impious criminal. Such persons, they
knew, had been sternly dealt with in the palmy days of the
Hebrew state, and the example of their most honored prophets
and their most pious kings would justify the severest measures
that could be taken against them. A spiritual reformer, then,
was not what they needed: a temporal leader was. And this
they had a perfect right to expect that the Messiah would be.
The very word itself—the Anointed One, a word commonly applied
to the king—indicates the possession of the powers of government.
Their prophecies all pointed to this conception of the
Messiah. Their popular traditions all confirmed it. Their political
necessities all encouraged it. The very disciples themselves
held it like the rest of their nation, for when they met Jesus after
his resurrection we find them inquiring, "Lord, wilt thou at this
time restore the kingdom of Israel?" (Acts i. 6.). The conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293"> 293</span>
may be imaginary, but the state of mind which such a question
indicates was doubtless real. The author represented them as
speaking as he knew that they had felt. Now, if ever they, who
had enjoyed the intimate friendship of Jesus, could still look to
him as one who would restore to Israel something of her bygone
grandeur, was it to be expected that the less privileged Jews,
who had inherited from their forefathers a fixed belief in this
temporal restoration, should suddenly surrender it at the bidding
of Jesus of Nazareth? For he at least did not realize the
prevailing notions of what the Messiah ought to be. For temporal
sovereignty he was clearly unfit, nor does he seem to have
ever demanded it. There was a danger no doubt that his enthusiastic
followers might thrust it upon him, and that, thus urged,
he might be tempted to accept it. But his general character
precludes the supposition that he could ever be fit to stand at
the head of a national movement. The absence, moreover, of
all political enthusiasm from his teaching proved him not to be
the Savior for whom they were looking. His assertions that he
was the Son of God, though they might provoke sedition and
endanger the security of his countrymen, could bring them no
corresponding good.</p>

<p>Christians have maintained that the Jews were entirely wrong
in their conception of the Messiah's character, and that Jesus
by his admirable life brought a higher and more excellent ideal
than theirs into the world. They admire him for not laying
claim to temporal dominion, and laud his humility, his meekness,
his submissiveness, the patience with which he bore his
sufferings, and the whole catalogue of similar virtues. It was,
according to them, the mere blindness of the Jews that prevented
them from recognizing in him a far greater Messiah than
they had erroneously expected. Moreover, they tell us that
another of the mistakes made by this gross nation was the
expectation of an earthly kingdom in which Christ was to reign,
whereas it was only a spiritual kingdom which he came to institute.
But who were to be judges of the character of the
Messiah if not the Jews to whom he was to come? The very
thought of a Messiah was peculiarly their own. It had grown
up in the course of their national history, and was embodied in
their national prophecies. They alone were its authorized in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294"> 294</span>terpreters;
they alone could say whether it was fulfilled in the
case of a given individual. It is surely a piece of the most
amazing presumption on the part of nations of heathen origin
to pretend that they are more competent than the Jews themselves
to understand the meaning of a Jewish term; a term,
moreover, which neither had nor could have before the time of
Jesus any sense at all except that which the Jews themselves
attached to it. Christians, who derive not only their idea of the
Messiah's character, but their very knowledge of the word, from
the case of Jesus alone, undertake to set right the Jews, among
whom it was a current notion for centuries before he had been
conceived in his mother's womb!</p>

<p>Granting, however, that this difficulty might have been surmounted,
supposing that it was a spiritual kingdom which the
ancient prophets under uncouth images referred to, the question
still remains whether Jesus in other respects fulfilled the conditions
demanded by Scripture. For this purpose it will be the
fairest method to confine ourselves to the discussion of those
prophecies alone which are quoted by the Evangelists, and are
therefore relied upon by them as proving their case. Where,
however, they have quoted only a portion of a prophecy, and
the remainder gives a somewhat different complexion to the
passage extracted, justice to their opponents requires that we
should consider the whole.</p>

<p>Take first the circumstances of Christ's birth. It was expected
that the Messiah was to be of the family of David, and
born at Bethlehem Ephratah. Now, according to two of our
authorities, he fulfilled both of these conditions. But, without
at all discussing the point whether their statement is true, it is
abundantly sufficient for the vindication of the Jews to observe,
that they neither knew, nor could know, anything at all, either
of his royal lineage or of his birth at Bethlehem. For he himself
never stated either of the two capital facts of which Luke and
Matthew make so much, nor does it appear that any of his disciples
alluded to them during his life-time. He was habitually
spoken about as Jesus of Nazareth. Matthew, in endeavoring
to account for the name by misquoting a prophecy, bears witness
to the fact that it expressed the general belief. Luke
makes him speak of Nazareth as his own country. Nowhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295"> 295</span>
does it appear that he repudiated the implication conveyed by
his ordinary title. Still less did he ever maintain—what his
over-busy biographers maintained for him—that he was of the
seed of David. Quite the reverse. He contends against the
Pharisees that the Messiah was not to be a descendant of David
at all. The dialogue as given by Matthew runs thus: "'What is
your opinion about the Christ? whose son is he?' They say to
him, 'David's.' He says to them, 'How then does David in the
spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said to my lord, Sit on
my right hand until I place thine enemies under thy feet? If
then David calls him lord, how is he his son?'" (Mt. xxii. 42-46).
No answer was given by the Pharisees, nor was any explanation
of the paradox ever granted them by Jesus. In the
absence, then, of any further elucidation we can only put one
interpretation upon his argument. It was clearly intended to
show not only that the Messiah <i>need</i> not, but that he <i>could</i> not
be of the house of David. David in that case would not have
called him Lord. The Pharisees may have been but little
impressed by the force of the argument, but of one thing they
could scarcely entertain a doubt. Jesus wished it to be thought
that he was the Messiah. He also wished it to be thought that the
Messiah was not a son of David. He himself therefore was certainly
not a son of David. But if anything more were needed
to excuse the ignorance—supposing it such—of the Jewish
rulers about the birthplace and family of Jesus, we find it even
super-abundantly in the work of one of his own adherents—the
fourth Evangelist. Not that this writer is to be taken as
an authority on the facts, but he is an authority on the views
that were current, at least in a portion of his own sect, and on
that which he himself—writing long after the death of Christ—had
received by tradition. Now, in the beginning of his Gospel
he describes Philip the disciple as going to Nathanael, and
saying, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and of
whom the prophets wrote, Jesus <i>the son of Joseph from Nazareth</i>."
At this Nathanael skeptically asks, "Can anything good
come from Nazareth?" and Philip replies, "Come and see"
(Jo. i. 45, 46). According to this account, then, the very disciples
of Jesus believed in his Nazarene nativity, as also (by the
way) in his generation by a human father. Nor is this all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296"> 296</span>
evidence. In another chapter an active discussion is represented
as going on among the Jews as to whether Jesus was the
Christ or not. Opinions differed. Foremost among the arguments
for the negative, however, was the appeal to the Scriptural
declaration that the Christ must be of David's seed, and emanate
from the village of Bethlehem (Jo. vii. 42). No answer to
this was forthcoming from the partizans of Jesus, nor is any
suggested by the Evangelist. There is but one rational inference
to be drawn from his silence. He either had not heard, or
he purposely ignored, the story of Christ's birth at Bethlehem,
and the genealogies which connected him with David. His
mind (if he had ever been a Jew) was to no small extent emancipated
from Jewish limitations, and with his highly refined
views of the Logos, he did not believe in the necessity of these
material conditions. It was nothing to him that they were not
fulfilled. More orthodox believers in the prophecies of the Old
Testament may be pardoned if they could not so lightly put
them aside. But what shall be said of the conduct of Jesus?
If he really were a descendant of David, born at Bethlehem, and
wrongly taken for a Nazarene, can we acquit him of an inexcusable
fraud upon the Jews in not bringing these facts under
their notice? Assuredly not. If, knowing as he did the weight
they would have in the public mind, he kept them back; knowing
that they would overcome some of the gravest objections
that were taken against his claim, he did not urge them in
reply; knowing at the close of his life that he was charged with
an undue assumption of authority, he did not produce them as
at least a portion of his credentials,—he played a part which it
would be difficult to stigmatize as severely as it deserves. He
believed that his reception by his nation would be an immense
benefit to themselves, yet he did not speak the word which
might have helped them to receive him. He thought he had a
mission from God, yet he failed to use one potent argument in
favor of the truth of that idea. He saw finally that he was
condemned to death for supposed impiety, yet he suffered the
Sanhedrim to incur the guilt of his condemnation without
employing one of his strongest weapons in his defense. Happily
we are not obliged to suspect him of this iniquity. The contradictory
stories by which his royal descent and his birth at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297"> 297</span>
Bethlehem are sought to be established sufficiently betray their
origin to permit us to believe in the honor and honesty of
Jesus.</p>

<p>Another Messianic prophecy which he is supposed to have
fulfilled is that of birth from a virgin, the necessity of which
was deduced from an expression of Isaiah's. That the writer of
the fourth Gospel was ignorant of this virgin-birth we have
already shown, and that the Jewish people in general took him
to be the son of Joseph is obvious enough from their allusions
to his father (Mk. vi. 3; Mt. xiii. 55, 56; Lu. iv. 22; Jo. vi. 42).
Here again he never contradicted the prevalent assumption.
But even had they known of the miraculous conception, the
Jews might have denied that the passage from Isaiah bore any
such construction as that put upon it by Matthew. He renders
it: "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a son"
(Mt. i. 23). But a more proper translation would be: "The
maiden shall conceive, and bear a son," for the word translated
<i>virgin</i> by Matthew does not exclude young women who have
lost their virginity. Nay, it curiously enough happens to be
used elsewhere of maidens engaged in the very conduct by
which they would certainly be deprived of it.</p>

<p>Moreover, the two prophecies quoted by Matthew, which
were, no doubt, familiar to the Jews, could by no possibility be
applied by them to a person of the character of Jesus. Even
the small fragments torn away from their context by the Evangelist
convict him of a misapplication. In the first fragment,
the Virgin's son is called Immanuel, a name which Jesus never
bore (Mt. i. 23). In the second, he is described as "a ruler, who
shall govern my people Israel," which Jesus never was (Mt. ii.
6). But the unlikeness of the predicted person to Jesus is still
further shown by comparing the circumstances as conceived by
the prophet with the actual circumstances of the time. Immanuel's
birth is to be followed, while he is still too young to
choose between good and evil, by a terrible desolation of the
land. Hosts, described as flies and bees, are to come from
Egypt and Assyria, and camp in the valleys, the clefts of the
rocks, the hedges and meadows. Cultivable land will produce
only thorns and thistles. Cultivated hills will be surrendered
to cattle from fear of thorns and thistles (Isa. vii. 14-25). Noth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298"> 298</span>ing
of all this happened in the time of Jesus. But the prophecy
of Micah is still more inappropriate. The "ruler" who is
to be born in Bethlehem is to lead Israel to victory over all
her enemies. He is to deliver his people from the Assyrian.
The remnant of Jacob is to be among the heathen, like a lion
among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks
of sheep. Its hand is to be lifted up against its adversaries,
and all its enemies are to be destroyed (Micah v).</p>

<p>These references to prophecy were certainly not happy. An
allusion by Matthew to the words, "The people who walk in
darkness see a great light," is not much more to the purpose,
for Isaiah in the passage in question proceeds to describe the
child who is to bring them this happiness as one who shall
have the government upon his shoulder, who is to be on the
throne of David, to establish and maintain it by right and justice
for ever (Mt. iv. 15, 16; Is. ix. 1-7). Another extract from
Isaiah, beginning, "Behold my servant whom I have chosen,"
and depicting a gentler character, is more appropriate, but is
too vague to be easily confined to any one individual.</p>

<p>Jesus himself is reported by one of his biographers to have
relied on certain words from the pseudo-Isaiah as a confirmation
of his mission. If the account be true, the circumstance
is of great importance as showing the view he himself took of
his office, and the means he employed to convince the Jews of
his right to hold it. Entering the synagogue at Nazareth, he
received the roll of the prophet Isaiah, and proceeded to read
from the sixty-first chapter as follows: "The Spirit of the Lord
Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah has anointed me to announce
glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the
broken-hearted; to cry to the captives, Freedom, and to those
in fetters, Deliverance; to cry out a year of good-will from
Jehovah." Here Jesus broke off the reading in the middle of
a verse, and declared that this day this scripture was fulfilled
(Lu. iv. 16-21). But let us continue our study of the prophetic
vision a little further. "To cry out a year of good-will from
Jehovah, and <i>a day of vengeance from our God</i>: to comfort all
that mourn; to appoint for the mourners of Zion,—to give them
ornaments for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, a garment of
praise for a desponding spirit; that they may be called oaks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299"> 299</span>
righteousness, a plantation of Jehovah to glorify himself. And
they will build up the ruins of old times, they will restore the
desolations of former days; and they will renew desolate cities,
the ruins of generation upon generation. And strangers shall
stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of foreigners shall be your
husbandmen and your vine-dressers. And you shall be called
'Priests of Jehovah;' 'Servants of our God,' shall be said to
you; the riches of the Gentiles you shall eat, and into their
splendor you shall enter" (Is. lxi. 1-6). Had Jesus concluded
the passage he had begun, he could scarcely have said, "This
day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears." The contrast between
the prediction and the fact would have been rather too
glaring.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking apparent similarity to Jesus is
found in the man described in such beautiful language by an
unknown prophet in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah. But
these words could hardly be applied to him by the Jews; in the
first place, because they would not be construed to refer to him
until after his crucifixion, seeing that they describe oppression,
prison, judgment, and execution; in the second place, because
there was no reason to believe that he bore their diseases, and
took their sorrows upon him. And although the familiar words—doubly
familiar from the glorious music of Handel,—"He was
a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief," may seem to us,
who know his end, to describe him perfectly, they could hardly
describe him to the Jews, who saw him in his daily life. In
that, at least, there was nothing peculiarly unhappy.</p>

<p>Failing the prophecies, which were plainly two-edged swords,
Jesus could appeal to his remarkable miracles. He and his disciples
evidently thought them demonstrations of a divine commission.
But, in the first place, it is clear that the evidence of
the most wonderful of these consisted only of the rumors circulating
among ignorant peasants, which the more instructed
portion of the nation very properly disregarded. Their demand
for a sign (Mt. xii. 38) proves that they were not satisfied by
these popular reports, if they had ever heard them. And in the
second place, those miracles which were better attested were
not convincing from the fact that others could perform them.
Jesus, charged with casting out devils by Baäl-zebub, the prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300"> 300</span>
of devils, adroitly retorted on the Pharisees by asking, if that
were so, by whom their sons cast them out? (Mk. iii. 22; Mt.
xii. 24-30; Lu. xi. 14-24). But thus he admitted that he was not
singular in his profession. Miracles, in short, were not regarded
by the Jews as any proof of Messiahship. Their own prophets
had performed them. Their own disciples now performed them.
Others might possibly perform them by diabolic agency. The
Egyptian magicians had been very clever in their contest with
Moses, though Moses had beaten them, and had performed far
more amazing wonders than those of Jesus, in so far as these
latter were known to the Pharisees.</p>

<p>Miracles being too common to confer any peculiar title to
reverence on the thaumaturgist, there remained the doctrine
and personal character of Jesus by which to judge him. It
must be borne in mind that the impression which these might
make upon his antagonist would depend mainly upon his bearing
in his relations with them. He might preach pure morals
in Galilee, or present a model of excellence to his own followers
in Judea; but this would not entitle him to reception as the
Messiah, nor would it remove an unfavorable bias created by
his conduct towards those who had not embraced his principles.
Let us see, then, what was likely to be the effect on the Pharisees,
scribes, and others, of those elements in his opinions
and his behavior by which they were more immediately affected.</p>

<p>There existed among the Jews, as there still exists among
ourselves, an institution which was greatly honored among
them, as it is still honored, though in a minor degree, among
ourselves. The institution was that of a day of rest sacred to
God once in every seven days. This custom they believed to
have been founded by the very highest authority, and embodied
by Moses in the ten commandments which he received on Sinai.
Nothing in the eyes of an orthodox Jew could be holier than
such an observance, enjoined by his God, founded by the greatest
legislator of his race, consecrated by long tradition. Now
the ordinary rules with regard to what was lawful and what
unlawful on this day were totally disregarded by Jesus. Not
only did his disciples make a path through a cornfield on the
Sabbath, but Jesus openly cured diseases, that is, pursued his
common occupation, on this most sacred festival (Mk. ii. 23<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301"> 301</span>iii.
7; Mt. xii. 1-14; Lu. vi. 1-11, xiii. 10-17, xiv. 1-6). When
these violations of propriety (as they seemed to them) first came
under the notice of the Pharisees, they merely remonstrated
with Jesus, and endeavored to induce him to restrain the impiety
of his disciples. Not only did he decline to do so, but he
expressly justified their course by the example of David, and
by that of the priests, who, according to his mode of reasoning,
profane the Sabbath in the temple by doing that to which by
their office they were legally bound. Such an argument could
scarcely convince the Pharisees, but they must have been
shocked beyond measure when he proclaimed himself greater
than the temple, and asserted his lordship even over the Sabbath-day.
They then inquired of him—a perfectly legitimate
question—whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, to
which he replied that if one of their own sheep had fallen into
the pit they would pick it out. Confirming his theory by his
practice, he at once healed a man with a withered hand. It is
noteworthy that the desire of the Pharisees to inflict punishment
upon Jesus is dated by all three Evangelists from this
incident; so that the hostility towards him may be certainly
considered as largely due to his unsabbatarian principles.</p>

<p>Now in this question it is almost needless for me to say that
my sympathies are entirely with Jesus. Although I do not
perceive in his conduct any extensive design against the Sabbath
altogether, yet it is much that he should have attempted
to mitigate its rigor. For that the world owes him its thanks.
But surely it cannot be difficult, in this highly sabbatarian
country, to understand the horror of the Pharisees at his apparent
levity. Seeing that it is not so very long since the supposed
desecration of the Sunday in these islands subjected the
offender to be treated as a common criminal; seeing that even
now a total abstinence from labor on that day is in many occupations
enforced by law; seeing that a custom almost as
strong as law forbids indulgence in a vast number of ordinary
amusements during its course,—we can scarcely be much surprised
that the sabbatarians of Judea were zealous to preserve
the sanctity of their weekly rest. The fact that highly conscientious
and honorable persons entertain similar sentiments
about the Sunday is familiar to all. We know that any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302"> 302</span>
who neglected the usual customs; who, for example, played a
game at cricket, or danced, or even pursued his commercial
avocations on Sunday, would be visited by them with perfectly
genuine reproaches. Yet this was exactly the sort of way in
which Christ and his disciples shocked the Jews. To make a
path through a cornfield and pluck the ears was just one of
those little things which the current morality of the Sabbath
condemned, much as ours condemns the opening of museums
or theatrical entertainments. Their piety was scandalized at
such a glaring contempt of the divine ordinances. Nor was the
reasoning of Jesus likely to conciliate them. To ask whether
it was lawful to do good or evil, to save life or to kill on the
Sabbath-day was nothing to the purpose. The question was
what <i>was</i> good or evil on that particular day, when things
otherwise good were by all admitted to be evil. Nor were the
cures effected by Jesus necessary to save life. All his patients
might well have waited till evening, when the Sabbath was
over. One of them, for instance, a woman who had suffered
from a "spirit of weakness" eighteen years, being unable to
hold herself erect, was surely not in such urgent need of attendance
that a few hours more of her disease would have done
her serious harm. Jesus, with his principles, was of course
perfectly right to relieve her at once, but it is not to be wondered
at that the ruler of the synagogue was indignant, and told the
people that there were six working days; in them therefore
they should come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath. The
epithet of "hypocrite," applied to him by Jesus, was, to say
the least, hardly justified (Lu. xiii. 10-17).</p>

<p>Another habit of Jesus, in itself commendable, excited the
displeasure of the stricter sects. It was that of eating with publicans
and sinners. This practice, and the fact of his neglecting
the fasts observed by the Pharisees, gave an impression of general
laxity about his conduct, which, however unjust, was perfectly
natural (Mk. ii. 15-22; Mt. ix. 10-17; Lu. v. 29-39). Here
again I see no reason to attribute bad motives to his opponents
who merely felt as "church-going" people among ourselves
would feel about one who stayed away from divine service, and
as highly decorous people would feel about one who kept what
they thought low company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303"> 303</span></p>

<p>Eating with unwashed hands was another of the several evidences
of his contempt for the prevalent proprieties of life
which gave offense. The resentment felt by the Pharisees at
this practice was the more excusable that Jesus justified it on
the distinct ground that he had no respect for "the tradition of
the elders," for which they entertained the utmost reverence.
This tradition he unsparingly attacked, accusing them of frustrating
the commandment of God in order to keep it (Mk. vii.
1-13; Mt. xv. 1-9). Language like this was not likely to pass
without leaving a deep-seated wound, especially if it be true (as
stated by Luke) that one of the occasions on which he employed
it was when invited to dinner by a Pharisee. Indifferent as the
washing of hands might be in itself, courtesy towards his host
required him to abstain from needless outrage to his feelings.
And when, in addition to the first offense, he proceeded to
denounce his host and host's friends as people who made the
outside of the cup and the platter clean, but were inwardly
full of ravening and wickedness, there is an apparent rudeness
which even the truth of his statements could not have excused
(Lu. xi. 37-39).</p>

<p>Neither was the manner in which he answered the questions
addressed to him, as to a teacher claiming to instruct the people,
likely to remove the prejudice thus created. The Evangelists
who report these questions generally relate that they
were put with an evil intent: "tempting him," or some such
expression being used. But whatever may have been the secret
motives of the questioners, nothing could be more legitimate
than to interrogate a man who put forward the enormous pretensions
of Jesus, so long as the process was conducted fairly.
And this, on the side of the Jews, it apparently was. There is
nowhere perceptible in their inquiries a scheme to entrap him,
or a desire to entangle him in difficulties by skillful examination.
On the contrary, the subjects on which he is questioned
are precisely those on which, as the would-be master of the
nation, he might most properly be expected to give clear
answers. And the judgment formed of him by the public would
naturally depend to a large extent on the mode in which he
acquitted himself in this impromptu trial. Let us see, then,
what was the impression he probably produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304"> 304</span></p>

<p>On one occasion the Pharisees came to him, "tempting him,"
to ascertain his opinion on divorce. Might a man put away his
wife? Jesus replied that he might not, and explained the permission
of Moses to give a wife a bill of divorce as a mere concession
to the hardness of their hearts. A divorced man or
woman who married again was guilty of adultery. Even the
disciples were staggered at this. If an unhappy man could
never be released from his wife, it would be better, they thought,
not to marry at all (Mk. x. 1-12; Mt. xix. 1-12). Much more
must the Pharisees have dissented from this novel doctrine.
Rightly or wrongly, they reverenced the law of Moses, and they
could not but profoundly disapprove this assumption of authority
to set it aside and substitute for its precepts an unheard of
innovation.</p>

<p>Another question of considerable importance was that relating
to the tribute. Some of the Pharisees, it seems, after praising
him for his independence, begged him to give them his
opinion on a disputed point: Was it lawful or not to pay tribute
to the Emperor? All three biographers are indignant at
the question. They attribute it as usual to a desire to "catch
him in his words," or, as another Evangelist puts it, to "entangle
him in his talk." Jesus (they remark) perceived what one
calls their "wickedness," a second their "hypocrisy," and the
third their "craftiness." "Why do you tempt me?" he began.
"Bring me a denarium that I may see it." The coin being
brought, he asked them, "Whose image and superscription is
this?" "Cæsar's." "Then render to Cæsar the things that are
Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's" (Mk. xii. 13-17;
Mt. xxii. 15-22; Lu. xx. 20-26). One of the Evangelists, reporting
this reply, rejoices at the discomfiture of the Pharisees,
who "could not take hold of his words before the people."
Doubtless his decision had the merit that it could not be taken
hold of, but this was only because it decided nothing. Taking
the words in their simplest sense, they merely assert what
nobody would deny. No Pharisee would ever have maintained
that the things of Cæsar should be given to God; and no partizan
of Rome would ever have demanded that the things of
God should be given to Cæsar. But practically it is evident that
Jesus meant to do more than employ an unmeaning form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305"> 305</span>
words. He meant to assert that the tribute was one of the
things of Cæsar, and that because the coin in which it was paid
was stamped with his image. More fallacious reasoning could
hardly be imagined, and it is not surprising that the Pharisees
"marveled at him." Nobody doubted that the Emperor possessed
the material power, and no more than this was proved
by the fact that coins bearing his effigy were current in the
country. The question was not whether he actually ruled Judea,
but whether it was lawful to acknowledge that rule by paying
tribute. And what light could it throw on this question to
show that the money used to pay it was issued from his mint?
It must almost be supposed that Jesus fell into the confusion
of supposing that the denarium with Cæsar's image and superscription
upon it was in some peculiar sense Cæsar's property,
whereas it belonged as completely to the man who produced it
at the moment as did the clothes he wore. Had the Roman
domination come to an end at any moment, the coin of the
Empire would have retained its intrinsic value, but the Romans
could by no possibility have founded a right of exacting tribute
upon the circumstance of its circulation. Either, therefore, this
celebrated declaration was a mere verbal juggle, or it rested on
a transparent fallacy.</p>

<p>After the Pharisees had been thus disposed of, their inquiries
were followed up by a puzzle devised by the Sadducees in order
to throw ridicule on the doctrine of a future state. These sectaries
put an imaginary case. Moses had enjoined that if a man
died leaving a childless widow, his brother should marry her
for the purpose of keeping up the family. Suppose, said they,
that the first of seven brothers marries, and dies without issue.
The second brother then marries her with the like result; then
the third, and so on through all the seven. In the resurrection
whose wife will this woman be, for the seven have had her as
their wife? To this Jesus replies: first, that his questioners
greatly err, neither knowing the Scriptures nor the power of
God; secondly, that when people rise from death they do not
marry, but are like angels; thirdly, that the resurrection is
proved by the fact that God had spoken of himself as the God
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that he is not the God of
the dead, but of the living (Mk. xii. 18-27; Mt. xxii. 23-33; Lu.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306"> 306</span>
xx. 27-40). Whether the Sadducees were or were not satisfied by
this answer we are not told, but it is quite certain that their
modern representatives could not accept it. For the inquirers
had hit upon one of the real difficulties attending the doctrine
of a future life. We are always assured that one of the great
consolations of this doctrine is the hope it holds out of meeting
again those whom we have loved on earth, and living with them
in a kind of communion not wholly unlike that which we have
enjoyed here. Earthly relationships, it is assumed, will be prolonged
into that happier world. There the parent will find
again the child whom he has lost, and the child will rejoin his
parent; there the bereaved husband will be restored to his wife,
and the widow will be comforted by the sight of the companion
of her wedded years. All this is simple enough. Complications
inevitably arise, however, when we endeavor to pick up again
in another life the tangled skein of our relations in this. Not
only may the feelings with which we look forward to meeting
former friends be widely different after many years' separation
from what they were at their death; but even in marriage there
may be a preference for a first or a second husband or wife,
which may render the thought of meeting the other positively
unpleasant. And if the sentiments of the other should nevertheless
be those of undiminished love, the question may well
arise, whose husband is he, or whose wife is she of the two?
Are all three to live together? But then, along with the comfort
of meeting one whom we love, we have the less agreeable
prospect of meeting another whom we have ceased to love. Or
will one of the two wives or two husbands be preferred and the
other slighted? If so, the last will suffer and not gain by the
reunion. Take the present case. Assume that the wife loved
only her first husband, but that all the seven were attached to
her. Then we may well ask, whose wife will she be of them?
Will her affections be divided among the seven, or will they all
be given to the first? In the former case, she will be compelled
to live in a society for which she has no desire; in the latter,
six of her seven husbands will be unable to enjoy the full benefit
of her presence. The question is merely evaded by saying
that in the resurrection there is neither marriage nor giving in
marriage, but that men are like angels. Either there is no con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307"> 307</span>solation
in living again, or there must be some kind of repetition
of former ties. Still less logical is the argument by which
Jesus attempts to prove the reality of a future state against
the Sadducees. In syllogistic form it maybe thus stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. God told
Moses in the bush that he was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob. Therefore they are not dead, but living (Mk. xii. 18-27; Mt.
xxii. 23-33; Lu. xx. 27-40).</p>
</div>

<p>What is the evidence of the major premiss? The moment it
is questioned it is seen to be invalid. Nothing could be more
natural than that Moses, or any other Hebrew, should speak of
his God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, meaning
that those great forefathers of his race had adored and been
protected by the same Jehovah in their day, but not therefore
that they were still living. The Sadducees must have been weak
indeed if such an argument could weigh with them for a moment.</p>

<p>After this a scribe or lawyer drew from Jesus the important
declaration that in his opinion the two greatest commandments
were that we should love God with the whole heart, soul, mind,
and strength; and our neighbors as ourselves (Mk. xii. 28-34;
Mt. xxii. 34-40; Lu. x. 25-37). How gratuitous the imputations
of ill-will thrown out against those who interrogate Jesus may
be, is admirably shown in the present instance. One Gospel
(the most trustworthy) asserts that the question about the first
commandment was put by a scribe, who thought that Jesus had
answered well, and who, moreover, expressed emphatic approval
of the reply given to himself. Such (according to this account)
was his sympathy with Jesus, that the latter declared that he
was not far from the kingdom of God. Mark now the extraordinary
color given to this simple transaction in another Gospel.
The Pharisees, we are told, saw that the Sadducees had been
silenced, and therefore drew together. Apparently as a result
of their consultation (though this is not stated), one of <i>them</i>
who was a lawyer asked a question, <i>tempting him</i>, namely,
Which is the great commandment in the law? Diverse, again,
from both versions is the narrative of a third. In the first
place, all connection with the preceding questions is broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308"> 308</span>
off, and without any preliminaries, a lawyer stands up, and,
<i>tempting him</i>, inquires, "Master, by what conduct shall I inherit
eternal life?" To which Jesus replies by a counter-question,
"What is written in the law?" and then, strange to say, these
two great commandments are enunciated, not by him, but by
the unknown lawyer, whose answer receives the commendation
of Jesus.</p>

<p>The bias thus evinced by the Evangelists, even in reporting
the fairest questions, seems to show that Christ did not like his
opinions to be elicited from him by this method, feeling perhaps
that it was likely to expose his intellectual weaknesses. In this
way, and possibly in others, a sentiment of hostility grew up
between himself and the dominant sects, which, until the closing
scenes of his career, was far more marked on his side than on
theirs. Beautiful maxims about loving one's enemies and returning
good for evil did not keep him from reproaching the
Pharisees on many occasions. Unfortunately, a man's particular
enemies are just those who scarcely ever appear to him
worthy of love, and this was evidently the case with Jesus and
the men upon whom he poured forth his denunciations. Judging
by his mode of speaking, we should suppose that all religious
people who did not agree with him were simply hypocrites.
This is one of the mildest terms by which he can bring himself
to mention the Pharisees or the scribes. Of the latter, he declares
that they devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make
long prayers; therefore they would receive the greater damnation
(Mk. xii. 40; Mt. xxiii. 14). The scribes and the Pharisees,
it is said, bind heavy burdens on others, and refuse to touch
them themselves (surely an improbable charge). They do all
their works to be seen of men (their outward behavior then was
virtuous). One of their grievous sins is that they make their
phylacteries broad, and enlarge the borders of their garments.
Worse still: they like the best places at dinner-parties and in
the synagogues (to which perhaps their position entitled them).
They have a pleasure in hearing themselves called "Rabbi," a
crime of which Christ's disciples are especially to beware. They
shut up the kingdom of heaven, neither entering themselves,
nor allowing others to enter. They compass sea and land to
make one proselyte, but all this seeming zeal for religion is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309"> 309</span>
worthless: when they have the proselyte, they make him still
more a child of hell than themselves. They pay tithes regularly,
but omit the weightier virtues; unhappily too common a
failing with the votaries of all religions. They make the outside
of the cup and platter clean, but within they are full of
extortion and excess. Like whited sepulchres, they look well
enough outside, but this aspect of righteousness is a mere cloak
for hypocrisy and wickedness. They honor God with their lips,
but their heart is far from him.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>He uses towards them such designations as these: "Scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites;" "you blind guides;" "you fools
and blind;" "thou blind Pharisee;" "you serpents, you generation
of vipers." If we may believe that he was the author of
a parable contained only in Luke, he used a Pharisee as his
typical hypocrite, and held up a publican—one of a degraded
class—as far superior in genuine virtue to this self-righteous
representative of the hated order (Lu. xviii. 9-14).</p>

<p>Had the Pharisees been actually guilty of the exceeding
wickedness which Jesus thought proper to ascribe to them, his
career would surely have been cut short at a much earlier stage.
As it was, they seem to have borne with considerable patience
the extreme license which he permitted himself in his language
against them. Nay, I venture to say that had he confined himself
to language, however strong, he might have escaped the
fate which actually befell him. And the evidence of this proposition
is to be found in the extreme mildness with which his
apostles were afterwards treated by the Sanhedrim, even when
they acted in direct disobedience to its orders (Acts iv. 15-21,
and v. 27-42). Only Stephen, who courted martyrdom by his
language, was put to death, and that for the legal offense of
blasphemy. Ordinary prudence would have saved Jesus. For
his arrest was closely connected with his expulsion of the
money-changers from the temple court. Not indeed that he was
condemned to death on that account, but that this ill-considered
deed was the immediate incentive of the legal proceedings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310"> 310</span>
which subsequently ended, contrary perhaps to the expectation
of his prosecutors, in his conviction by the Sanhedrim on a capital
charge. Let us consider the evidence of this. For the convenience
of persons going to pay tribute to the temple, some
money-changers—probably neither better nor worse than others
of their trade—sat outside for the purpose of receiving the current
Roman coinage and giving the national money, which
alone the authorities of the temple received in exchange. Certain
occasions in life requiring an offering of doves, these too
were sold in the precincts of the temple, obviously to the advantage
of the public. Had Jesus disapproved of this practice,
he might have denounced it in public, and have endeavored to
persuade the people to give it up. Instead of this, he entered
the temple, expelled the buyers and sellers (by what means we
do not know), upset the money-changers' tables and the dove-sellers'
seats, and permitted no one to carry a vessel through
the temple. "Is it not written," he exclaimed, "'My house
shall be called a house of prayer for all nations?' but you
have made it a den of thieves" (Mk. xi. 15-18; Mt. xxi. 12, 13;
Lu. xix. 45-48). The action and the words were alike unjustifiable. The
extreme care of the Jews to preserve the sanctity of
their temple is well known from secular history. Nothing that
they had done or were likely to do could prevent it from remaining
a house of prayer. And even if they had suffered it to be
desecrated by commerce, was it, they would ask, for Jesus to
fall suddenly upon men who were but pursuing a calling which
custom had sanctioned, and which they had no reason to think
illegal or irreligious? Was it for him to stigmatize them all
indiscriminately as "thieves"? Plainly not. He had, in their
opinion, exceeded all bounds of decorum, to say nothing of law,
in this deed of violence and of passion. Thus, there was nothing
for it now but to restrain the further excesses he might
be tempted to commit.</p>

<p>No immediate steps were, however, taken to punish this
outrage. It is alleged that Jesus escaped because of the reputation
he enjoyed among the people. At any rate, the course
of the authorities was the mildest they could possibly adopt.
They contented themselves with asking Jesus by what authority
he did these things, a question which assuredly they had every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311"> 311</span>
right to put. He answered by another question, promising if
they answered it, he would answer theirs. Was John's baptism
from heaven or from men? Hereupon the Evangelists depict
the perplexity which they imagine arose among the priests.
If they said, from heaven, Jesus would proceed to ask why they
had not received him; if from men, they would encounter the
popular impression that he was a prophet. All this, however,
may be mere speculation; we return within the region of the
actual knowledge of the Evangelists when we come to their
answer. "And they say in answer to Jesus, '<i>We do not know.</i>'
And Jesus says to them, '<i>Neither do I tell you</i> by what authority
I do these things.'" (Mk. xi. 27-33; Mt. xxi. 23-27; Lu. xx.
1-8). Observe in this reply the conduct of Jesus. He had
promised the priests that if they answered his question, he
would also answer theirs. They <i>did</i> answer his question as
best they could, and he refused to answer theirs! Even in
the English version, where the contrast between him and them
is disguised by the employment of the same word "tell" as the
translation of two very different verbs in the original, the distinction
between "We <i>cannot</i> tell" and "I <i>do not</i>," that is
"will not tell" is palpable enough. But it is far more so in
the original. The priests did not by any means decline to
answer the question; they simply said, what may very likely
have been true, that they did not know whence the baptism of
John was. In the divided state of public opinion about John,
nothing could be more natural. They could not reply decidedly
if their feelings were undecided. Their reply, "We do not
know," was then a perfectly proper one. The corresponding
reply on the part of Jesus would have been, "I do not know
by what authority I do these things;" but this of course it was
impossible to give. The chief priests, scribes and elders had
more right to ask Jesus to produce his authority for his assault
than he had to interrogate them about their religious opinions.
But Jesus, though he had for the moment evaded a difficulty,
must have been well aware that he was not out of danger. He
found it necessary to retire to a secret spot, known only to
friends. Here, however, he was discovered by his opponents, and
brought before the Sanhedrim to answer to the charges now
alleged against his character and doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312"> 312</span></p>

<p>To some extent these charges are matter of conjecture. The
Gospels intimate that there was much evidence against him
which they have not reported. Now it is impossible for us to
do complete justice to the tribunal which heard the case unless
we know the nature and number of the offences of which the
prisoner was accused. One of them, the promise to destroy the
temple and rebuild it in three days, may have presented itself
to their minds as an announcement of a serious purpose, especially
after the recent violence done to the traders. However
this may be, there was now sufficient evidence before the court
to require the high priest to call upon Jesus for his reply. He
might therefore have made his defense if he had thought
proper. He declined to do so. Again the high priest addressed
him, solemnly requiring him to say whether he was the Christ,
the Son of God. Jesus admitted that such was his conviction,
and declared that they would afterwards see him return in the
clouds of heaven. Hereupon the high priest rent his clothes,
and asked what further evidence could be needed. All had
heard his blasphemy; what did they think of it? All of
them concurred in condemning him to death (Mk. xv. 53-64;
Mt. xxvi. 57-66; Lu. xxii. 66-71).</p>

<p>The three Evangelists who report the trial all agree that the
blasphemy thus uttered was accepted at once as full and sufficient
ground for the conviction of Jesus. Now, I see no reason
whatever to doubt that the priests who were thus scandalized
by his declaration were perfectly sincere in the horror they
professed. All who have at all realized the extremely strong
feelings of the Jews on the subject of Monotheism, will easily
understand that anything which in the least impugned it would
be regarded by them with the utmost aversion. And a man
who claimed to be the Son of God certainly detracted somewhat
from the sole and exclusive adoration which they considered to
be due to Jehovah. As indeed the event has proved; for the
Christian Church soon departed from pure Monotheism, adopting
the dogma of the Trinity; while Christ along with his
Father, and even more than his Father, became an object of
its worship. So that if the Jews considered it their supreme
obligation to preserve the purity of their Jehovistic faith, as
their Scriptures taught them to believe it was, they were right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313"> 313</span>
in putting down Jesus by forcible means. No doubt they were
wrong in holding such an opinion. It was not, in fact, their
duty to guard their faith by persecution. They would have
been morally better had they understood the modern doctrine
of religious liberty, unknown as it was to Christians themselves
until some sixteen centuries after the death of Christ. But for
their mistaken notions on this head they were only in part
responsible. They had inherited their creed with its profound
intolerance. Their history, their legislators, their prophets, all
conspired to uphold persecution for the maintenance of religious
truth. They could not believe in their sacred books, and
disbelieve the propriety of persecution. Before they could leave
Jesus at large to teach his subversive doctrines, they must have
ceased to be Jews; and this it was impossible for them to do.
We must not be too hard upon men whose only crime was that
they believed in a false religion.</p>

<p>According to the dictates of that religion, Jesus ought to
have been stoned. But the Roman supremacy precluded the
Jews from giving effect to their own laws. Jesus was therefore
taken before the procurator, and accused of "many things."
The charge of blasphemy of course would weigh nothing in the
mind of a Roman; and it is evident that another aspect of the
indictment was brought prominently before Pilate: namely, the
pretension of Jesus to be king of the Jews. As to the substantial
truth of this second charge, we are saved the necessity of
discussion, for Jesus himself, when questioned by Pilate, at
once admitted it. But whether it was made in malice, and in
a somewhat different sense from that in which Pilate understood
it, is not so clear. Jesus at no time, so far as we know, put
forward any direct claim to immediate temporal dominion. At
the same time it must be remembered that the ideas of Messiahship
and possession of the kingdom were so intimately connected
in the minds of the Jews, that they were probably unable
to dissociate them. Unfit as Jesus plainly was for the exercise
of the government, they might well believe that, if received
by any considerable number of the people, it would be forced
upon him as the logical result of his career. Nor were these
fears unreasonable. His entry into Jerusalem riding on an ass
(an animal expressly selected as emblematic of his royalty),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314"> 314</span>
with palm-branches strewed before him, and admirers calling
"Hosanna!" as he went, pointed to a very real and serious
danger. Another such demonstration might with the utmost
ease have passed into a disturbance of the peace, not to say a
tumult, which the Romans would have quenched in blood unsparingly
and indiscriminatingly shed. Jesus was really therefore
a dangerous character, not so much to the Romans, as to
the Jews. Not being prepared to accept him as their king in
fact, they were almost compelled in self-preservation to denounce
him as their would-be king to Pilate.</p>

<p>His execution followed. His supposed resurrection, and the
renewed propagation of his faith, followed that. It has been
widely believed that because Christianity was not put down by
the death of its founder, because, indeed, it burst out again in
renewed vigor, therefore the measures taken against him were
a complete failure, and served only to confer additional glory
and power on the religion he had taught. But this opinion
arises from a confusion of ideas. If they aimed at preserving
their own nation from what they deemed an impious heresy—and
I see no proof that they aimed at anything else—the Jewish
authorities were perfectly successful. Christianity, which, if
our accounts be true, threatened to seduce large numbers of
people from their allegiance to the orthodox creed, was practically
extinguished among the Jews themselves by the death of
Christ. They could not possibly believe in a crucified Messiah.
Only a very small band of disciples persisted in adhering to
Jesus, justifying their continued faith by asserting that he had
risen from the tomb. But it was no longer among the countrymen
of Jesus, whom he had especially sought to attach to his
person and his doctrine, that this small remnant of his followers
could find their converts. Neither then, nor at any subsequent
time, has Christianity been able to wean the Jews from
their ancient faith. The number of those who, from that time
to this, have abandoned it in favor of the more recent religion
has been singularly small. If, as is probable, there was during
the earthly career of Jesus a growing danger that his teaching
might lead to the formation of a sect to which many minds
would be attracted, that danger was completely averted.</p>

<p>True, Christianity, when rejected by the Jews, made rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315"> 315</span>
progress among the Gentiles. But it was no business of the
authorities at Jerusalem to look after the religion of heathen
nations. They might have thought, had they foreseen the
future of Christianity, that a creed which originated among
themselves, and had in it a large admixture of Hebrew elements,
was better than the worship of the pagan deities. Be
this as it may, the particular form of error which the Gentiles
might embrace was evidently no concern of theirs. But they
had a duty, or thought they had one, towards their own people,
who looked to them for guidance, and that was to preserve the
religion that had been handed down from their forefathers uncorrupted
and unmixed. This they endeavored to do by stifling
the new-born heresy of Jesus before it had become too powerful
to be stifled. Their measures, having regard to the end they
had in view, were undoubtedly politic, and even just.</p>

<p>For were they not perfectly right in supposing that faith in
Christ was dangerous to faith in Moses? The event has proved
it beyond possibility of question. Not indeed that they could
perceive the extent of the peril, for neither Jesus nor any of
his disciples has ventured then to throw off Judaism altogether.
But they did perceive, with a perfectly correct insight, that the
Christians were setting up a new authority alongside of the
authorities which alone they recognized,—the Scriptures and the
traditional interpretation of the Scriptures. And it was precisely
the adoption of a new authority which they desired to
prevent. So completely was their foresight on this point justified,
that not long after the death of Christ, his assumed followers
received converts without circumcision, that all-essential
rite; and that, after the lapse of no long period of time,
Judaism was entirely abandoned, and a new religion, with new
dogmas, new ritual, and new observances, was founded in its
place. Surely the action of the men who sat in judgment upon
Jesus needs no further justification, from their own point of
view, than this one consideration. They had no more sacred
trust, in their own eyes, than to prevent the admission of any
other object of worship than the Lord Jehovah. Christ speedily
became among Christians an object of worship. They owned
no more solemn duty than to observe in all its parts the law
delivered by their God to Moses. That law was almost instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316"> 316</span>
abandoned by the Christian Church. They knew of no more
unpardonable crime than apostasy from their faith. That apostasy
was soon committed by the Jewish Christians.</p>

<p>On all these grounds, then, I venture to maintain that the
spiritual rulers of Judea were not so blameworthy as has been
commonly supposed in the execution of Jesus of Nazareth.
Judged by the principles of universal morality, they were undoubtedly
wrong. Judged by the principles of their own religion,
they were no less undoubtedly right.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 5.</span>—<i>What did he think of himself?</i></h5>

<p>Having endeavored, as far as our imperfect information will
admit, to realize the view that would be taken of Jesus by contemporary
Jews, let us seek if possible to realize the view
which he took of himself. In what relation did he suppose
himself to stand to God the Father? And in what relation to
the Hebrew law? What was his conception of his own mission,
and of the manner in which it could best be fulfilled?</p>

<p>Though, in replying to these questions, we suffer somewhat
from the scarcity of the materials, we do not labor under the
same disadvantages as those we encountered in the preceding
section. For there we had to judge between two bitterly hostile
parties, of which only one had presented its case. And from
the highly colored statement of this one party we had to unravel,
as best we could, whatever circumstances might be permitted
to weigh in favor of the other. Here we have no conflicting
factions to obscure the truth. The opinion formed by
Jesus of himself has been handed down to us by his own disciples,
who, even if they did not perfectly understand him, must
at least have understood him far better than anybody else. And
if the picture they give us of the conception he had formed of
his own office be consistent with itself, there is also the utmost
probability that it is true. Especially will this hold good if this
conception should be found to differ materially from that not
long afterwards framed about him by the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Consider first the idea he entertained concerning his Messianic
character, and his consequent relation to God. His conviction
that he was the Messiah, who was sent with a divine mes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317"> 317</span>sage
to his nation, was evidently the mainspring of his life. It
was under this conviction that he worked his cures and preached
his sermons. Probably it strengthened as he continued in his
career, though of this there is no possible evidence. Possibly,
however, the instructions he gave on several occasions to those
whom he had healed, and once to his disciples, to tell no man
about him, arose from a certain diffidence about the power by
which his miracles were effected (<i>E.g.</i>, Mk. i. 44; Mt. ix. 30), and
a reluctance to accept the honor which the populace would have
conferred upon him. However this may be, he certainly put
forward his belief on this subject plainly enough, and its acceptance
by his disciples no doubt confirmed it in his own mind,
while its rejection by the nation at large, especially the more
learned portion of it, gave a flavor of bitterness to the tone in
which he insisted upon it. The title by which he habitually
designates himself is the Son of man. This was, no doubt,
selected as a more modest name than "Son of God." The latter
was never (if we exclude the fourth Gospel) applied by Jesus
to himself, but when applied to him by others, he made no
objection to it, but accepted it as his due. The inference from
his behavior is, that he liked to be thought the Son of God (as
indeed is shown by his eulogy of Peter when that apostle had
so described him) (Mt. xvi. 17; vers. 18 and 19 are probably interpolations),
but that he did not quite venture to claim the title
for himself. That he was ever imagined, either by himself or
others, to be the Son of God in the literal, materialistic sense
in which the term was afterwards understood, it would be an
entire mistake to suppose. No such notion had ever been formulated
by the Jewish mind, and it would, no doubt, have filled
his earliest disciples with horror. As Mr. Westcott truly observes,
"Years must elapse before we can feel that the words
of one who talked with men were indeed the words of God"
(Canon of New Testament, p. 64). Nor was the Hebrew Jehovah
the sort of divinity who would have had a son by a young village
maiden. Proceedings of that kind were left to the heathen
deities. Nor did Christ, in claiming a filial relationship to God,
ever intend to claim unity with the divine essence, still less to
assert that he actually was God himself. This notion of identity
would receive no sanction even from the fourth Gospel, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318"> 318</span>
does, quite unlike its predecessors, lend some sanction to that
of unity in nature. The best proof of this is that Jesus never,
at any period of his life, desired his followers to worship him,
either as God or as the Son of God. Had he believed of himself
what his followers subsequently believed of him, that he
was one of the constituent persons in a divine trinity, he must
have enjoined his apostles both to address him in prayer themselves,
and to desire their converts to address him. It is quite
plain that he did nothing of the kind, and that they never supposed
him to have done so. Belief in Christ as the Messiah
was taught as the first dogma of apostolic Christianity, but adoration
of Christ as God was not taught at all. But we are not
left in this matter to depend on conjectural inferences. The
words of Jesus are plain. Whenever occasion arose, he asserted
his inferiority to the Father (as Milton has proved to demonstration),<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
though, as no one had then dreamt of his equality,
it is natural that the occasions should not have been frequent.
He made himself inferior in knowledge when he said that of
the day and hour of the day of judgment no one knew, neither
the angels in heaven, nor the Son; no one except the Father
(Mk. xiii. 32). He made himself inferior in power when he said
that seats on his right hand and on his left in the kingdom of
heaven were not his to give (Mk. x. 40); inferior in virtue when
he desired a certain man not to address him as "Good master,"
for there was none good but God (Mk. x. 18). The words of his
prayer at Gethsemane, "all things are possible unto thee," imply
that all things were not possible to him; while its conclusion,
"not what I will, but what thou wilt," indicates submission
to a superior, not the mere execution of a purpose of his
own (Mk. xiv. 36). Indeed, the whole prayer would have been a
mockery, useless for any purpose but the deception of his disciples,
if he had himself been identical with the Being to whom
he prayed, and had merely been giving effect by his death to
their common counsels. While the cry of agony from the cross,
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mk. xv. 34,)
would have been quite unmeaning if the person forsaken and
the person forsaking had been one and the same. Either, then,
we must assume that the language of Jesus has been misre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319"> 319</span>ported,
or we must admit that he never for a moment pretended
to be co-equal, co-eternal, or con-substantial with God.</p>

<p>Throughout his public life he spoke of himself as one who
was sent by God for a certain purpose. What was that purpose?
Was it, as the Gentile Christians so readily assumed, to
abolish the laws and customs of the Jews, and to substitute
others in their stead? Did he, for example, propose to supplant
circumcision by baptism? the Sabbath by the Sunday? the
synagogue by the church? the ceremonial observances of the
law of Moses by observances of another kind? If so, let the
evidence be produced. For unless we find among his recorded
instructions some specific injunction to his disciples that they
were no longer to be Jews, but Christians, we cannot assume
that he intended any such revolution. Now, not only can no
such injunction be produced, but the whole course of his life
negatives the supposition that any was given. For while teaching
much on many subjects, he never at any time alludes to
the Mosaic dispensation as a temporary arrangement, destined
to yield to a higher law. Yet it would surely have been strange
if he had left his disciples to guess at his intentions on this all-important
subject. Moreover, it came directly in his way when
he censured the Pharisees. He frequently accuses them of
overlaying the law with a multitude of unnecessary and troublesome
rules; but while objecting to these, he never for a
moment hints that the very law itself was now to become a
thing of the past. Quite the reverse. The Pharisees were very
scrupulous about paying tithes and disregarded weightier matters;
these, he says, they ought to have done, and not to have
left the other undone. If those tithes were no longer to be
paid (at least not for the same objects), why does he not say so?
Again, he charges them with transgressing the commandment
of God by their tradition; where it is the accretions round the
law, and not the law itself, which he attacks. In one case he
even directly imposes an observance of the legal requirements
on a man over whom he has influence (Mk. i. 44). Moreover,
he himself evidently continued to perform the obligations of
his Jewish religion until the very end of his life, for one of his
last acts was to eat the passover with his disciples. The only
institution which he apparently desires to alter at all is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320"> 320</span>
Sabbath, and there it is plain that he aims at an amendment
in the mode of its observance, not at its entire abolition.
Indeed, he justifies his disciples by invoking the example of
David, an orthodox Hebrew; and very happily remarks, that
the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath—one of
his best and most epigrammatic sayings. But an institution
made for man was indeed one to be rationally observed, but by
no means one to be lightly tampered with. Jesus, in fact, was
altogether a Jew, and though an ardent reformer, he desired to
reform within the limits of Judaism, not beyond them.</p>

<p>If further proof were needed of this than the fact that he
himself neither abandoned the religion of his birth, nor sought
to obtain disciples except among those who belonged to it, it
would be found in his treatment of the heathen woman whose
daughter was troubled with a devil. To her he distinctly
declared that he was not sent except to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel. In reply to her further persistence, he told her
that it was not well to take the children's meat and throw it to
dogs. Nothing but her appropriate yet modest answer induced
him to accede to her request (Mt. xv. 21-28). Further confirmation
is afforded by his instructions to his disciples, whom he
desired not to go either to the Gentiles or the Sâmaritans, but
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel (Mt. x. 5, 6). His own
practice was altogether in conformity with these instructions.
He markedly confined the benefits of his teaching to his fellow-countrymen.
Once only is he said to have visited the neighborhood
of Tyre and Sidon, and then he was anxious to preserve
the strictest incognito (Mk. vii. 24). Even when the Jews
refused to believed in him, he sought no converts among the
Gentiles. He never even intimated that he would receive such
converts without their previous adoption of the Jewish faith,
and after his decease his most intimate disciples were doubtful
whether it was lawful to associate with uncircumcised people
(Acts x. 28; xi. 2, 3). Not only, therefore, had he himself never
done so, but he had left no instructions behind him that such a
relaxation of Jewish scruples might ever be permitted. True,
when disappointed among his own people, he now and then
contrasted them in unflattering terms with the heathen. Chorazin
and Bethsaida were worse than Tyre and Sidon; Caper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321"> 321</span>naum
less open to conviction than Sodom (Mt. xi. 20-24). The
faith of the heathen centurion was greater than any he had
found in Israel (Mt. viii. 10). But all these expressions of
embittered feeling imply that it was in Israel he had looked for
faith, towards Israel that his desires were turned. To discover
faith out of it might be an agreeable surprise, but as a general
rule, was neither to be expected nor sought.</p>

<p>Having, then, determined, what the purport of his mission
was not, let us try to discover what it was. The quest is not
difficult. The whole of his teaching is pervaded by one ever-recurring
keynote, which those who have ears to hear it cannot
miss. He came to announce the approach of what he termed
"the kingdom of heaven." A great revolution was to take
place on earth. God was to come, accompanied by Jesus, to
reward the virtuous and to punish the wicked. A totally new
order of things was to be substituted in lieu of the present unjust
and unequal institutions. And Jesus was sent by God to
warn the children of Israel to prepare for this kingdom of
heaven. There was but little time to lose, for even now the
day of judgment was at hand. The mind of Jesus was laden
with this one great thought, to which, with him, all others were
subordinate. It runs through his maxims of conduct, his parables,
his familiar converse with his disciples. Far from him
was the notion of founding a new religion, to be extended
throughout the world and to last for ages. It was a work of
much more immediate urgency which he came to do. "Prepare
for the kingdom of heaven, for it will come upon you in the
present generation;" such was the burden of his message. Let
us hear his own mode of delivering it to men.</p>

<p>The very beginning of his preaching, according to Mark, was
in this strain: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God
has approached; repent, and believe the Gospel" (Mk. i. 15).
Precisely similar is the purport of his earliest doctrine according
to Matthew (Mt. iv. 7). How thoroughly he believed that
the time was fulfilled is shown by his decided declaration that
there were some among his hearers who would not taste of
death till they had seen the kingdom of God come with power
(Mk. ix. 1), a saying which, as it would never have been invented,
is undoubtedly genuine. He told his disciples that Elias, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322"> 322</span>
was expected to precede the kingdom of heaven, had already
come (Mk. ix. 13).</p>

<p>Over and over again, in a hundred different ways, this absorbing
thought finds expression in his language. The one and
only message the disciples are instructed to carry to the
"lost sheep of the house of Israel" is that the kingdom of
heaven is at hand (Mt. x. 17). When a city does not receive
them, they are to wipe off the dust of it against them, and bid
them be sure that the kingdom of God is near them (Lu. x. 11).
In the coming judgment, Chorazin, Bethsaida, and above all
his own place Capernaum, were to suffer more than Tyre and
Sidon. Earthly matters assume, in consequence of this conviction
of their temporary nature, a very trivial aspect. The disciples
are to take no thought for the morrow; the morrow will
take thought for itself. Nor are they to trouble themselves
about food and clothing, but to seek first the kingdom of God
(Mt. vi. 31-34). They are not to lay up treasure on earth, but
in heaven, in order that their hearts may be there (Mt. vi. 19-21).
Moreover, they must be always on the watch, as the Son
of man will come upon them at an unexpected hour. It would
not do then to be engaged as the wicked antediluvians were
when overtaken by the flood, in the occupations of eating and
drinking, or marrying and giving in marriage. Instead of this,
they must be like the faithful servant whom his master on
returning to his house found watching (Mt. xxiv. 38, 42, 43; Lu.
xii. 37, 38). Preparation is to be made for the kingdom which
their Father will give them by selling what they have and bestowing
alms, so laying up an incorruptible treasure; by keeping
their loins girded and their lights burning (Lu. xii. 32).
Neglect of these precautions will be punished by exclusion from
the joys of the kingdom, as shown in the parable of the ten
virgins (Mt. xxv. 1-13). But the indications of the great event
are not understood by the people, who are able to read the
signs of the coming weather, but not those of the times (Lu.
xii. 54-57); an inability which might have been due to the fact
that they had had some experience of the one kind of signs and
none of the other. On another occasion, he observes that the
law and the prophets were till John; since then the kingdom
of God has been preached, and every man presses into it (Lu.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323"> 323</span>
xvi. 16). Here he specially proclaims himself as the preacher
of the kingdom; the man who brought mankind this new revelation.
Such was the manner in which this revelation was announced,
that some at least of those who heard him thought
that the kingdom was to come immediately. To counteract
this view he told the parable of the nobleman who went from
home to receive a kingdom, leaving his servants in charge of
certain monies, and rewarded them on his return according to
the amount of interest they had obtained by usury, punishing
one of them who had made no use of the sum intrusted to him
(Lu. xix. 11-27). He himself, of course, was the nobleman who
received his kingdom and returned again to judge his servants.
So urgent was the message he had to deliver, that (according to
one Evangelist) a man who wished to bury his father before
joining him was told to let the dead bury their dead, but to go
himself and announce the kingdom of God; while another, who
asked leave to bid farewell to his family, was warned that no
man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, was
fit for that kingdom (Lu. ix. 58-62).</p>

<p>The arrival of the kingdom was to be preceded by various
signs. There would be false Christs; there would be wars,
earthquakes, and famines; there would be persecutions of the
faithful; but the Gospel (that is, the announcement of the approach
of this new state of things) must first be published in
all nations.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Then the sun and moon would be darkened and
the stars fall; the Son of man would come in power and glory,
and gather his elect from all parts of the earth. The existing
generation was not to pass till all these things were done. Not
even the Son knew when this would happen; but as it might
come suddenly and unexpectedly upon them, they were to be
continually on the watch (Mk. xiii.; Mt. xxiv). The apostles
would not even finish the cities of Israel before the Son of man
had come (Mt. x. 23).</p>

<p>Little is said in description of the nature of the kingdom of
heaven except by the method of illustration. The main result
to be gathered from numerous allusions to it is that justice is to
prevail. Thus, the kingdom of heaven is said to be like a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324"> 324</span>
who sowed good seed in his field, but in whose property an
enemy maliciously mingled tares. At the harvest the tares are to
be burnt, and the wheat gathered into the barn. This parable
Jesus himself explained. The tares are the wicked; the wheat
represents "the children of the kingdom." And as tares are
burnt, so "the Son of man shall send his angels, and collect
from his kingdom all offenses, and those who do wickedness, and
shall throw them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth. Then the just shall shine out like
the sun in the kingdom of their Father." The same idea is
expressed in the illustration of the net cast into the sea, which
gathers good fish and bad. Just as the fishermen separate these,
so the angels at the end of the world will separate the wicked
from the midst of the just. Other comparisons represent the
influence on the heart of faith in the kingdom. Thus, the kingdom
of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which, though
the smallest of seeds, becomes the largest of herbs. Or it is
like leaven leavening three measures of meal. Again, it is like
treasure hid in a field, or a pearl of great price (Mt. xiii. 24-50).</p>

<p>The best qualification for preëminence in the kingdom was
humility.</p>

<p>When asked who was to be greatest in the kingdom of
heaven, Jesus replied that it would be he who humbled himself
like a little child (Mt. xviii. 1-4). He delights in the exhibition
of striking contrasts between the present and the future state
of things. The first are to be the last, and the last first. Those
who have made great sacrifices now are then to receive vast
rewards (Mk. x. 29-31). He who has lost his life for his sake is
to find it, and he who has found it is to lose it (Mt. x. 39). The
stone rejected by the builder is to become the head of the corner
(Mk. xii. 10). The kingdom of God is to be taken from the
privileged nation and given to another more worthy of it (Mt.
xxi. 43). Publicans and harlots are to take precedence of the
respectable classes in entering the kingdom (Mt. xxi. 31). It is
scarcely possible for rich men to enter it at all, though God may
perhaps admit them by an extraordinary exertion of power (Mk.
x. 23-27). Many even who trust in their high character for correct
religion will find themselves rejected. But they will be
safe who have both heard the sayings of Jesus and done them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325"> 325</span>
They will have built their houses on rocks, from which the
storms which usher in the kingdom will not dislodge them.
Those, however, who hear these sayings, and neglect to perform
them, will be like foolish men who have built their houses on
sand, where the storms will beat them down, and great will be
their fall (Mt. vii. 22-29). That the kingdom is to be on earth,
not in some unknown heaven, is manifest from the numerous
references of Jesus to the time when the Son of man will
"come;" a time which none can know, yet for which all are to
watch. He never speaks of men "going" to the kingdom of
heaven; it is the kingdom of heaven which is to come to them.
And the most remarkable of the many contrasts will be that
between the present humiliation of the Son and his future
glory. He will return to execute his Father's decrees. His
judges themselves will see him "sitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven" (Mt. xxvi. 64).
Instead of standing as a prisoner at the bar, he will then be
enthroned as a judge. "When the Son of man shall come in
his glory, and all the angels with him, then he shall sit on the
throne of his glory; and all the nations shall be collected
before him, and he shall separate them from one another, as
the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and he shall
put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left."
The goats, who have done harm, are then to go into everlasting
punishment; and the sheep, who have done good, are to pass
into eternal life (Mt. xxv. 31-46).</p>

<p>This equitable adjustment of rewards and punishments to
merit and demerit is the leading conception in the revolution
which the kingdom of heaven is to make. The faithful servant
is to be made ruler over his master's goods; the unfaithful one
to be cut off and assigned a portion with the hypocrites. The
virgins whose lamps are ready burning will be admitted to the
marriage festival. The servants who make the best use of the
property committed to their charge will be rewarded, while
those who have failed to employ it properly will be cast into
outer darkness (Mt. xxiv. 42-xxv. 30). So also the wicked husbandmen
in the vineyard, who ill treated their master's servants
and killed his heir, are to be destroyed when he comes,
and the vineyard is to be committed to other cultivators (Mk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326"> 326</span>
xii. 1-9). All those, on the other hand, who have made great
sacrifices for the sake of Christ will receive a hundred-fold compensation
for all that they have now abandoned (Mt. xix. 29, 30).</p>

<p>Such was the sort of notion—rude, yet tolerably definite—which
Jesus had formed of the kingdom his Father was about
to found, and for the coming of which he taught his disciples
to pray. This hope of a reign of justice, of an exaltation of the
lowly and virtuous, and a depression of the proud and wicked,
animated his teaching and inspired his life. To make known
this great event, so shortly to overtake them, to mankind, was
a duty with which in his opinion he had been charged by God;
to receive this message at his hands was in his judgment the
first of virtues, to spurn it the most unpardonable of crimes.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 6.</span>—<i>What did his disciples think of him?</i></h5>

<p>There is on record a remarkable conversation which affords
us a glimpse, both of the rumors that were current about Christ
among the people, and also of the view taken of him by his
nearest friends during his life-time. Jesus had gone with his
disciples into the towns of Cæsarea Philippi. On the way, being
apparently curious about the state of public opinion, he asked
them, "Whom do men say that I am?" To this they replied,
"John the Baptist; and some say Elias, and others that thou
art one of the prophets." To which Jesus rejoined, "But you,
whom say you that I am?" Peter returned the answer, "Thou
art the Messiah;" or "Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the
living God." It is remarkable that Peter alone is represented
as replying to this second question, as if the others had not yet
attained to the conviction which this apostle held of the Messiahship
of Jesus. Especially would this conclusion be confirmed
if we adopted the version of Matthew, where Jesus expresses
his high approbation of Peter's answer (Mk. viii. 27-30; Mt. xvi.
13-20). If this apostle was peculiarly blessed on account of his
perception of this truth, it may be inferred that his companions
had either not yet perceived, or were not yet sure of it. That
Peter did not mean by calling him the Messiah to state that he
was a portion of the deity himself, is evident from what follows;
for Jesus having predicted his future sufferings, "Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327"> 327</span>
began to rebuke him," anxious to avert the omen. Had he
believed that it was God himself with whom he was conversing,
he could hardly have ventured to question his perfect
knowledge of the future.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the divinity of Christ is not, in fact, to be
found in the New Testament. Even the writer of the fourth
Gospel, who holds the highest and most mystical view of his
nature, does not teach that. Often indeed in that Gospel does
Jesus speak of himself as one with the Father. But the dogmatic
force of all these expressions is measured by the fact
that precisely in the same sense he speaks of the disciples as
one with himself. As the Father and he are in one another, so
he prays that the disciples may be one in them (Jo. xvii. 21).
Moreover, when the Jews charged him with making himself
God, he met them by inquiring whether it was not written in
their law, "I said, Ye are gods." If, then, those to whom the
word of God came were called gods, was it blasphemy in him,
whom the Father had sanctified and sent, to say, "I am the
Son of God?" (Jo. x. 33-37). Here, then, the term which Jesus
appropriates is "Son of God," and this he considers admissible
because the Hebrew people generally had been called gods.
Evidently, then, he does not admit the charge of making himself
God.</p>

<p>The authority of the fourth Gospel is, of course, of no value
in enabling us to determine what Jesus said or did, but it is of
great value as evidence of the view taken about him by those
of his disciples who, at this early period, had advanced the furthest
in the direction of placing him on a level with God himself.
It is either the latest, or one of the latest, compositions
in the New Testament, and it proves that, at the period when
its author lived, even the boldest spirits had not ventured on
the dogma which afterwards became the corner-stone of the
Christian creed.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the canonical books, Jesus is simply
the Messiah, the Son of God; in whom, in that sense, it is a
duty to believe. Whoever believes this much is, according to
the first epistle of John, born of God (1 John v. 1).</p>

<p>Clearer still is the evidence that, in the opinion of those
most competent to judge, Jesus had no intention of abolishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328"> 328</span>
the observance of the law of Moses. So far were his disciples
from imagining that he contemplated any such change, that
they were at first in doubt whether it was allowable for them
even to relax the rules which forbade social intercourse with
heathens. The writer of the Acts of the Apostles, however, informs
us that, when an important convert was to be won over
from the pagan ranks, Peter had the privilege of a vision which
enjoined him not to call anything which God had cleansed
common or unclean. Interpreting this to mean that he might
associate with the Gentiles, he received the heathen convert,
Cornelius, with all cordiality, and even preached the gospel of
Jesus to the uncircumcised company by whom he was surrounded.
That this was a novel measure is plainly evinced by
the fact that the Jewish Christians who were present were
astonished that the gift of the Holy Ghost should be poured
out upon the Gentiles. They therefore had conceived that
Christianity was to be confined to themselves (Acts x).</p>

<p>But there is more direct evidence of the same fact. When
Peter returned to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers there
found fault with him because he had gone in to uncircumcised
men, and had eaten with them. Peter, of course, related his
vision in self-defense, and since there was no reply to be made
to such an argument as this, they accepted the new and unexpected
fact which he announced: "Well, then, God has given
repentance to life to the Gentiles also" (Acts xi. 1-18). Paul,
who was too strong-minded to need a revelation to teach him
the best way of promoting Christian interests, also received
heathen converts without requiring them to come under Jewish
obligations. But the conduct of these apostles was far from
meeting with unmixed approbation in the community. Some
men from Judea came to Antioch, where Paul and Barnabas
were, and informed the brethren there that unless they were
circumcised they could not be saved. So important was this
question deemed, that Paul and Barnabas, after much disputing
with these Judaic Christians, agreed to go with them to Jerusalem
to refer the matter to a council of the apostles and elders.
Obviously, then, it was a new case which had arisen. No
authoritative <i>dictum</i> of Jesus could be produced. The possibility
of having to receive heathens among his disciples was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329"> 329</span>
he had never contemplated. Called to deal with this supremely
important question, on which the whole future of the Church
turned, the apostles displayed moderation and good sense. Acting
on the concurrent advice of Peter, Paul, James, and Barnabas,
they wrote to the brethren in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia,
that they had determined to lay no greater burden upon them
than these necessary things:—1. Abstinence from meat offered
to idols; 2. from blood; 3. from things strangled; 4. from fornication.
Hence it will be seen that they absolved the heathen
believers from all Jewish observances except two, those that
forbade blood and things strangled. These, from long habit and
the fixed prejudices of their race, no doubt appeared to them to
have some deeper foundation than a mere arbitrary command.
These therefore they enjoined even upon pagans (Acts xv.
1-31).</p>

<p>Be it observed, however, that this dispensation applied only
to those who were not of Hebrew blood. The apostles and
elders assembled at Jerusalem had no thought of dispensing
<i>themselves</i> from the binding force of the law of Moses. To observe
it was alike their privilege and their duty. They did not
conceive that, in becoming Christians, they had ceased to be
Jews, any more than a Catholic who becomes a Protestant conceives
that he has ceased to be a Christian. The question
whether those who had been born Jews should abandon their
ancient religion was not even raised at this time among them.
The only question was whether those who had not been born
Jews should adopt it.</p>

<p>Innovation, however, is not to be arrested at any given point.
Liberty having been conceded to the Gentiles, it was not unnatural
that some of the apostles, when living among the Gentiles,
should take advantage of it for themselves. No overt
rule was adopted on this subject. It seems to have been tacitly
understood that all Jews should continue to be bound by the
rigor of their native customs, except in so far as they had been
modified by common consent: and the attempt of some to escape
from this burden was an occasion of no small scandal to the
more orthodox members of the sect (Acts xxi. 20; Gal. ii. 12).
Both Peter and Paul indeed, at separate times, were compelled
to make some concessions to the extremely strong feeling in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330"> 330</span>
favor of the law which existed at headquarters. The conduct
of these two eminent apostles merits examination.</p>

<p>Peter, it appears, never gave up Judaism in his own person;
but when staying at Antioch he mixed freely with Gentiles,
making no attempt to impose the law upon them, and approving
of the proceedings of Paul. It so happened, however, that
there came to Antioch some brethren from James at Jerusalem.
These men were strict Jews, and Peter was so much afraid of
them, that he "withdrew and separated himself" from his
former companions. The other Jewish Christians, and even
Barnabas, the former friend of Paul, were induced to act in the
same way. Paul, who was not likely to lose the opportunity of
a little triumph over Peter, ruthlessly exposed his misconduct.
According to his account, he publicly addressed him in these
terms: "If thou, being a Jew, livest like a Gentile and not like
a Jew, why dost thou compel the Gentiles to be like Jews?"
(Gal. ii. 11-14.). What answer Peter returned, or whether he
returned any, Paul does not inform us. His charge against
Peter I understand to be, not that the apostle had positively
adopted heathen customs, and then taken up Jewish ones
again, but that he had relaxed in his own favor the rules which
forbade Jews from eating with Gentiles. On the appearance of
the stricter Christians from Jerusalem he put on the appearance
of a strictness equal to their own. Such conduct was consistent
with the character of the disciple who had denied his master.</p>

<p>Paul himself, on the other hand, was a complete freethinker.
Once converted, the system of which he had formerly been the
zealous upholder no longer had any power over his emancipated
mind. His robust and logical intellect soon delivered him from
the fetters in which he had been bound. Far, however, from
following his example, the Christians at Jerusalem were shocked
at the laxity of his morals. The steps he took to conciliate
them are graphically described in the Acts of the Apostles. On
visiting the capital, Paul and his companions went to see James,
with whom were assembled all the elders; and Paul described
the success he had met with among the Gentiles. Hereupon
the assembled company, or more probably James as their
spokesman, informed Paul what very disadvantageous reports
were current concerning him. "Thou seest, brother," they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331"> 331</span>
began, "how many thousands of believers there are among the
Jews, and all are zealots for the law; and they have been informed
of thee that thou teachest the Jews among the Gentiles
apostasy from Moses, saying that they should not circumcise
their children, nor walk in the customs. What is it, then? It
is quite necessary that the multitude should meet, for they will
hear that thou art come. Do then this that we tell thee. We
have four men who have a vow upon them; take these and be
purified with them, and bear the expense with them of having
their heads shaven; and all will know that there is nothing in
what they have heard about thee, but that thou also walkest
in the observation of the law" (Acts xxi. 20-24). This sensible
advice was adopted by Paul; and the "zealots for the law,"
who composed the Christian community at Jerusalem, had the
satisfaction of seeing him purify himself and enter the temple
with the men under the vow. On a later occasion, too, when
charged with crime before Felix, Paul mentioned the fact that
twelve days ago he had gone up to worship at Jerusalem, as if
he had been an orthodox Jew (Acts xxiv. 11).</p>

<p>But although he might think it expedient to satisfy James
and his friends at Jerusalem by a concession to public opinion,
the rumor which had reached the brethren there, if unfounded
in the letter, was in fact an accurate representation of the inevitable
outcome of Paul's teaching. Possibly he did not wish
to press his own views upon others of his nation, and therefore
did not interfere with such of them as, though living among
heathens, yet adhered religiously to their national customs.
But unquestionably his own feelings were strongly enlisted in
favor of the abolition of the law, and if the Jewish Christians
read and accepted his writings, they could hardly fail to adopt
his practice. The law in his opinion was no longer necessary
for those who believed in Christ. He is not the true Jew who
is one outwardly, nor is that the true circumcision which is
outward. He is a Jew who is so internally, and circumcision is
of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter. If it be asked what
advantage the Jew has, Paul replies that he has much: the
first of all, that to his nation were confided the oracles of God
(Rom. ii. 28, 29, iii. 1, 2). He knows, he says, and is persuaded
in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean in itself, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332"> 332</span>
to him who thinks it so it may be unclean. It is well to abstain
from eating flesh or drinking wine, or anything else that
may give offense to others, but these things are all unimportant
in themselves. One man esteems one day above another; another
man esteems them all alike; let each be fully persuaded
in his own mind. Only let us not judge one another, nor put
stumbling-blocks in one another's way (Rom. xiv).</p>

<p>From these considerations it appears that the suspicions
entertained of Paul at Jerusalem were substantially true. Possibly
he did not absolutely teach the Jews to abandon the law;
possibly he did not even completely abandon it himself. But in
his writings he constantly treats it as a thing indifferent in
itself; Christians might or might not believe in its obligations,
and provided they acted conscientiously, all was well. Along
with these very skeptical opinions, however, Paul strongly held
to the necessity of worldly prudence. He is very indignant with
the "false brethren privily introduced, who slipped in to spy
out the liberty we have in Jesus Christ, that they might enslave
us; to whom," he adds, "we did not yield by subjection even
for an hour" (Gal. ii. 4, 5). But whether the brethren at Jerusalem
required him to clear himself from the report that he
was not an observer of the law, there came in another principle
of action, which he has himself explained with praiseworthy
frankness. "To the Jews," he tells the Corinthians, "I became
as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to those under
the law as under the law, not being myself under the law,
that I might gain those under the law; to those without law,
as without law (not being without law to God, but law-abiding
to Christ), that I might gain those without law; to the
weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak; I became all
things to all men, that by all means I might save some" (1
Cor. ix. 20-22). Acting on this elastic rule, Paul might easily
comply with all the demands of James and his zealots. To the
Jews he became a Jew for the nonce. It was perhaps in the
same spirit of worldly wisdom that he took the precaution of
circumcising a young convert who was Jewish only on the
mother's side, his father having been a Greek (Acts xvi. 1-3).</p>

<p>While such was the conduct of this strong-minded reformer,
it is plain that his attitude towards the law was not shared by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333"> 333</span>
the personal friends of Jesus. James at Jerusalem adhered
strictly to Judaism. The other apostles, so far as we know, did
the same. The rest of the brethren there did the same. Paul
was tolerated, and even cordially received, as the apostle of the
Gentiles, but it does not appear that he had any following
among the Jews. Had any of the original apostles followed
him in his bold innovations, he would surely have mentioned
the fact, as he has mentioned the partial adhesion of Peter.
On the contrary, he seems in his epistles, when attacking the
Judaic type of Christianity, to be arguing as much against
them as against the unchristian Jews or the heathen.</p>

<p>Stronger evidence than mere inference is, however, obtainable
on this point. The Jewish Christians, who had received
their doctrines direct from the companions of Jesus, soon came
to form a sect apart, and were known by the name of Ebionites.
Of these men, Irenæus tells us that "they use the Gospel
according to Matthew only, and repudiate the apostle Paul,
maintaining that he was an apostate from the law." Moreover,
"they practice circumcision, persevere in the observance of
those customs which are enjoined by the law, and are so Judaic
in their style of life, that they even adore Jerusalem as if it
were the house of God" (Adv. Hær. i. 26). It was a strange fate
that befell these unfortunate people, when, overwhelmed by the
flood of heathenism that had swept into the Church, they were
condemned as heretics. Yet there is no evidence that they had
ever swerved from the doctrines of Jesus, or of the disciples
who knew him in his life-time. Jesus himself had been circumcised,
and he certainly never condemned the rite, or spoke of
it as useless for the future. He was so Judaic in his style of
life that he reverenced the temple at Jerusalem as "a house of
prayer for all nations," and deemed it his special duty to purify
it from what he regarded as pollution. But the torrent of progress
swept past the Ebionites, and left them stranded on the
shore.</p>

<p>Should the position here maintained with reference to the
Judaic character of the early Christians be thought to require
further confirmation, I should find it in the weighty words of a
theologian who, while entirely Christian in his views, is also one
of the highest authorities on the history of the Church. Nean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334"> 334</span>der,
speaking of this question, observes that the disciples did
not at once arrive at the consciousness of that vocation which
Christ (in his opinion) had indicated to them, namely, that they
should form a distinct community from that of the Jews. On the
contrary, they attached themselves to this community in every respect,
and all the forms of the national theocracy were holy to
them. "They lived in the conviction that these forms would continue
as they were till the return of Christ, by which a new and
higher order of things was to be founded; and this change they
expected as one that was near at hand. Far from them, therefore,
lay the thought of the foundation of a new cultus, even if from
the light of belief in the Redeemer new ideas had dawned upon
them about that which belonged to the essence of the true
adoration of God. They took part as zealously in the service of
the temple as any pious Jews. Only they believed that a sifting
would take place among the theocratic people, and that the
better part of it would be incorporated in <i>their</i> community by
the recognition of Jesus as the Messiah" (Neander, Pflanzung
der Christlichen Kirche, vol. i. p. 38). Neander proceeds to
point out—and here too his remarks are valuable—that the
outward forms of Judaism gave facilities for the formation of
such smaller bodies within the general body, by means of the
division into synagogues. The Christians, therefore, constituted
merely a special synagogue, embraced within the mass of
believers who all accepted the law of Moses, all worshiped at
the temple of Jerusalem. It will be seen, however, that I differ
from Neander in so far as he supposes that the members of
the Christian synagogue, in adhering to Judaism, were neglecting
any indications given by their founder. On the contrary, it
appears to me a more reasonable explanation of their conduct
that the founder himself had never contemplated that entire
emancipation from Judaic forms which was soon to follow.</p>

<p>On these two points, then—the humanity of Jesus and his
Judaism—the early history of the Church affords our position
all possible support. How is it about the third—his announcement
of a kingdom of heaven soon to come? Paul must
have derived his doctrine on this point, whatever it was,
from those who were disciples of Christ before him, for it
does not appear that he had any special revelation on the sub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335"> 335</span>ject.
Let us hear what was the impression made upon his
mind by their report of the teaching of Jesus. "We do not
wish you to be ignorant, brethren"—so he writes to the Thessalonians—"that
you may not grieve like the rest who have
no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, thus
also will God bring those who sleep through Jesus. For this
we say to you <i>by the word of the Lord</i>" (Paul therefore is speaking
with all the authority of his apostolic commission), "<i>that
we who are alive and are left for the coming of the Lord</i> shall
not take precedence of those who are asleep. For the Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with the word of command,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God,
and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive
and are left shall be snatched with them in the clouds to meet
the Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with the
Lord" (1 Thess. iv. 13-17). Clearer than this it is difficult to be.
There can be no question whatever, unless we put an arbitrary
significance on these words, that Paul looked for the second
coming of Christ and the final judgment long before the existing
generation had passed away. Some will fall asleep before
that day, but he fully expects that he himself and many of
those whom he is addressing will be alive to witness it. So
confident is he of this, that he even describes the order in which
the faithful will proceed to join their Lord, the dead taking a
higher rank than the living. He differs from Jesus, and probably
from the other apostles, in placing the kingdom of heaven
somewhere in the clouds, and not on earth. But he entirely
agrees with them as to the date of the revolution. Quite consistent
with the above passage is another (of which, however,
the correct reading is doubtful): "We shall not all sleep, but
we shall all be changed."</p>

<p>Filled with the like hope, he prays that the spirit, mind,
and <i>body</i> of the Thessalonians may be preserved blameless to
the coming of Christ (1 Thess. v. 23). And he comforts them in
a subsequent letter by the promise that they who are troubled
shall have "rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus
from heaven with the angels of his power" (2 Thess. i. 7). While,
in writing to the Corinthians, he speaks of the existing generation
as those "upon whom the ends of the ages have come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336"> 336</span></p>

<p>Not less clear is the language of the other apostles. Peter
on that memorable day of Pentecost when the apostles exhibit
the gift of tongues, and some irreverent spectators are led to
charge them with inebriety, explains to the assembly that the
scene which had just been witnessed was characteristic of the
"last days," as foretold by the prophet Joel. In those days
their sons and their daughters were to prophesy, their young
men to see visions, and their old men to dream dreams; the
Spirit was to be poured out on God's servants and handmaidens;
there were to be signs and wonders; blood, fire, and smoke;
the sun was to be turned into darkness, and the moon into
blood; and whoever called on the name of the Lord was to be
saved. Thus Peter, than whom there could be no higher
authority as to the mind of Christ, applied to his own time the
prophetic description of the "day of the Lord" given by Joel
(Acts ii. 14-21). James exhorts his disciples not to be in too
great a hurry for the arrival of Christ. They are to imitate the
husbandman waiting for the ripening of his crops. "Be you
also patient: confirm your hearts; for the coming of the Lord
draws near" (James v. 7, 8). The author of the first epistle of
Peter distinctly informs the Christian community that "the
end of all things is at hand." And he warns them not to think
it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try them, "but
rejoice, inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ; that
in the revelation of his glory you may also rejoice with exceeding
joy" (1 Pet. iv. 7, 12, 13). Further on he promises that
when the chief Shepherd appears, they shall receive "the unfading
crown of glory" (1 Pet. v. 4). In the first epistle of John
the disciples are thus exhorted: "And now, little children, remain
in him, that when he comes we may have boldness, and
may not be ashamed before him at his coming" (1 Jo. ii. 28).</p>

<p>In the next chapter he tells them that, "when he appears we
shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (1 Jo. iii. 2).
Of the Apocalypse it cannot be necessary to speak in detail.
The one great thought that inspires it from beginning to end
is that of the speedy return of Jesus, accompanied as it will be
by the judgment of the wicked, the reward of the faithful, and
the establishment of a new heaven and a new earth far more
glorious and more beautiful than those that are to pass away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337"> 337</span>
The end of the book is conclusive as to its meaning: "I, Jesus,
have sent my angel to testify these things to you in the
churches." "He that testifies these things says, 'Surely I come
quickly. So be it; come, Lord Jesus'" (Rev. xxii. 16, 20).</p>

<p>There is another passage bearing on this subject, which, as
it appears to have been written at a later date than any of
those hitherto quoted, may best be considered last. It is found
in the second epistle attributed to Peter. The epistle was probably
written after the first generation of Christians had passed
away, but the forger endeavors to assume the style of the apostle
whose name he borrows. From the language he employs it
is evident that there was some impatience among believers in
his day on account of what seemed to them the long delay in
the second coming of Christ. Scoffers had arisen, who were
putting the awkward question, "Where is the promise of his
coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as
they were from the beginning of creation." Such scoffers, he
tells them, are to come "in the last days," and he warns them
how to resist the influence of their specious arguments. For
this purpose he reminds them of the former destruction of the
earth by water, and assures them that the present heavens and
the present earth are to be destroyed by fire. They are not to
let the consideration escape them that with the Lord one day is
a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. Hence God
is not really slow about fulfilling his promise, as some people
believe; he is only waiting out of kindness, not being willing
that any should perish, but desiring that all should come to
repentance. But the day of the Lord will come unexpectedly,
like a thief in the night; wherefore the Christians who are looking
for new heavens and a new earth, according to his promise,
must take care to be ready that they may be found by him spotless
and blameless (2 Pet. iii). Here, then, we have a further
proof of the hopes entertained by the early Christians; for this
writer, who evidently felt that the promises held out by the
original apostles were in danger of being discredited by the
long delay in the expected catastrophe, concerns himself to
show that the postponement of its arrival is not after all so
great as it may seem, and seeks to dispel the doubts that had
grown up concerning it. He thus bears important testimony to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338"> 338</span>
the nature of the expectations entertained by those who had
gone before him.</p>

<p>But even if we had not this epistle, we should find some
evidence of the same fact in the writings of the earliest fathers.
Thus, in the first epistle of Clement, the Christians are warned
in the following language:—</p>

<p>"Far from us be that which is written, 'Wretched are they
who are of a double mind and of a doubting heart;' who say,
'These things we have heard even in the time of our fathers;
but behold, we have grown old and none of them has happened
unto us!' Ye foolish ones! compare yourselves to a tree; take
[for instance] the vine. First of all it sheds its leaves, then it
buds, next it puts forth leaves, and then it flowers; after that
comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened fruit. Ye
perceive how in a little time the fruit of a tree comes to maturity.
Of a truth, soon and suddenly shall his will be accomplished,
as the Scripture also bears witness, saying, 'Speedily
will he come, and not tarry;' and, 'The Lord shall suddenly
come to his temple, even the Holy One, for whom ye look'"
(First Ep. of Clement, ch. xxiii.—A. N. L., vol. i. p. 24).</p>

<p>Further on, the same writer expressly states that what the
apostles of Christ preached was the speedy advent of the new
order of things. "Having therefore received their orders, and
being fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and established in the word of God, with full assurance
of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the kingdom
of God was at hand" (Ibid., ch. xli.—A. N. L., vol. i. p. 37).
Here, then, we have authority of this very early writer for the
statement that such was the view taken of the mission of Jesus
by his original disciples.</p>

<p>Again, in the second epistle of Clement, this expression
occurs:—"Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the kingdom
of God in love and righteousness, since we know not the day
of the appearing of God" (Second Ep. of Clement, ch. xii.—A.
N. L., vol. i. p. 62). Thus it appears that the apostles received
from Jesus, and the early Christians from the apostles, the doctrine
that the return of the Messiah in his glory would take
place soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339"> 339</span></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 7.</span>—<i>What are we to think of him?</i></h5>

<p>We come now to the most important question of all, namely,
what opinion the evidence we possess should lead us to form of
the moral character of Jesus, and of the value of his teaching.
In considering this subject, we are met at the threshold of the
inquiry by the extreme difficulty of discarding the traditional
view which has gained currency among us. Not only believers
in the Christian religion, but freethinkers who look upon Christ
as no more than an extraordinary man, have united to utter
his praises in no measured terms. His conduct has been supposed
to present an ideal of perfection to the human race, and
his aphorisms to embody the supreme degree of excellence and
of wisdom. Some critics, not being Christians, have even gone
so far as to assume that whatever items in his reported language
or behavior seemed to reflect some discredit upon him
could not be genuine, but must be due to the imaginations of
his disciples.</p>

<p>All this unbounded panegyric naturally raises in the minds
of critics who have freed themselves from the accepted tradition
a slight prejudice against him, and this may lead them to
regard his errors with too unsparing a severity, and to mete
out scant justice to the merits he may really possess. No task
can be less easy than that of approaching this question with a
mind entirely devoid of bias on the one side or on the other.
For my own part, I shall endeavor, if I cannot attain perfect
impartiality, at least neither to praise nor to blame without
adequate reason.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, however, it may be well to state that I
shall not attempt to discriminate between the authentic and
the unauthentic utterances of Jesus, but shall take for granted
that his reporters—excluding the fourth Evangelist—have in
the main reported him correctly. No doubt this position is not
strictly true. There must be errors, and there may be grave
errors in the record, since those who transmitted the language
of their master trusted only to memory. But it is on the whole
much more likely that the parables, sermons, and short sayings
ascribed to Jesus represent with some approach to fidelity what
he really said, than that they, or any considerable portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340"> 340</span>
them, were invented by any of his disciples afterwards. They
have, moreover, a characteristic flavor which it would have
been difficult for a forger to give to the fictitious utterances he
might have added to the genuine remains. It is, however, a
question of minor import whether the synoptical writers are or
are not faithful reporters. Jesus is presented to our admiration
by them as the Son of God, and as a pattern of virtue and of
wisdom. Therefore, even if we are not criticising a portrait
from life, we are at least criticising the ideal portrait which
they have held up as an object of worship, and which Christendom
has accepted as such.</p>

<p>Omitting (as already considered) those very considerable portions
of his doctrine which refer to himself and to his kingdom,
we may proceed to the more strictly ethical elements which are
to be found scattered about in his instructions to his hearers,
sometimes contained in those striking parables which, following
the habit of his nation, he was fond of relating; sometimes in
the short, clear, and incisive sentences of which he was a master.
In considering the value and originality of his views, it
will be of advantage to compare them, where we can, with those
of other great teachers of mankind.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most conspicuous peculiarities is his fondness
for impressive contrasts. He has a peculiar pleasure in
contemplating the reversal of existing arrangements. The first
are to be last; the humble exalted; the poor preferred to the
rich; the meanest to become the greatest, and so forth. Strangely
similar to this favorite idea, so continually making its appearance
in his moral forecasts, is the language frequently used by
his Chinese predecessor Laò-tsé, who in more than one respect
greatly resembles him. Thus Jesus tells his disciples that he
who is greatest among them shall be their servant, and that
he who exalts himself shall be abased, while he who humbles
himself shall be exalted (Mt. xxiii. 10, 11). Elsewhere he declares
that if any man desire to be first, he shall be last, and
servant of all (Mk. ix. 35). Presenting a child, to render his
lesson the more impressive, he tells them that he who humbles
himself like this little child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
(Mt. xviii. 4). Exactly in the same tone Laò-tsé observes that
"the holy man places himself behind, and comes to the front;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341"> 341</span>
neglects himself and is preserved" (T. t. k., ch. vii). Heaven,
according to the same sage, does precisely as Jesus expects his
Father to do in the kingdom of heaven. "It lowers the high,
it raises the low. The way of heaven is to diminish what is
superfluous, to complete what is deficient. The way of man is
not this; he diminishes what is deficient to add it to what is
superfluous" (T. t. k., ch. lxxvii).</p>

<p>On the same subject of humility, an opinion of the philosopher
Mang, or Mencius, may be compared with one of Christ's.
There was a strife among the disciples of the latter which should
be accounted the greatest. Christ said: "The kings of the earth
have dominion over them, and they who have authority over them
are called benefactors. But be not you so: but let the greater
among you be as the younger, and he that leads as he that
serves" (Lu. xxii. 25, 26). Now Mang in like manner warns his
disciples against the craving for authority. "Mencius said:
'The superior man has three things in which he delights, and
to be ruler over the empire is not one of them. That his father
and mother are both alive, and that the condition of his brothers
affords no cause for anxiety;—this is one delight. That,
when looking up, he has no occasion for shame before heaven;
and below, he has no occasion to blush before men;—this is a
second delight. That he can get from the whole empire the
most talented individuals, and teach and nourish them;—this
is the third delight. The superior man has three things in
which he delights, and to be ruler over the empire is not one
of them'" (Mang, vii. 1, 20.—C. C., vol. ii. p. 334). This definition
of the pleasures of the high-minded man is quite equal of
its kind to anything that has been said on the same subject by
Jesus. It is true that Mang ranges over a somewhat wider
field, and that therefore the sentences just quoted do not admit
of exact comparison with anything coming from Jesus. But
while both agree in reprobating the desire to exercise power,
Mang goes beyond Jesus in proposing to substitute other interests
for that of political ambition. And these interests are of
the best kind. His "superior man" rejoices in the prosperity
of his family, in the consciousness of his innocence of any disgraceful
conduct, and in his opportunities of teaching those
who are most worthy of his instructions and most likely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342"> 342</span>
carry on his work. The latter is a pleasure which is rarely
mentioned, and it shows much thoughtfulness on the part of
the philosopher to have upheld it as an object in life.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, another Chinese sage has anticipated
another of the best points in the doctrine of Jesus. Jesus enjoined
his hearers not to practice charity in a public and ostentatious
manner, like the hypocrites, "but when thou doest alms,
let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth" (Mt. vi,
3). In this admirable maxim he would have had the support of
all true Confucians, for one of their canonical writers had also
told them that "it is the way of the superior man to prefer
the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more
illustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety,
while he daily goes more and more to ruin" (C. C., i. 295.—Chung
Yung, ch. xxxiii. 1).</p>

<p>On another question, that of the admonition of an erring
friend, Jesus gave an opinion which is in perfect accord with
an opinion given by Confucius. If a man's brother trespass
against him, he is first, according to Jesus, to take him to task
in private; should that fail, to call in two or three witnesses
to hear the charge; and should the offender still be obdurate,
to inform the Church.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> If his impenitence continue even after
this, he is to become to him "as a heathen and a publican"
(Mt. xviii. 15-17). Turning to the conversations of Confucius, we
find the following:—"Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The
Master said, 'Faithfully admonish your friend, and kindly try
to lead him. If you find him impracticable, stop. Do not disgrace
yourself'" (Lun Yu, b. xii. ch. 33.—C. C., i. 125). The
steps inculcated by the two teachers are, making allowance for
difference of country, almost identical.</p>

<p>The thoughts as well as the language of Jesus are often reproduced
with singular fidelity in the sacred works of Buddhists.
As the Buddha is, on the whole, the prophet whose
character approaches most closely to that of Jesus, so we are
almost certain to find in the literature of Buddhism nearly all
the most exalted features of his ethical teaching. Thus Jesus
praises the poor widow who contributes her mite to the temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343"> 343</span>
treasury, because she has given all that she had. In one of
the numerous legends supposed to have been related by Sakyamuni
an exactly similar incident occurs. A former Buddha was
traveling through various countries, accompanied by his attendant
monks. The rich householders presented them with all
kinds of food as offerings. A poor man, who had no property
whatever, and lived by collecting wood in the mountains and
selling it, had gained two coins by the pursuit of his industry.
Perceiving the Buddha coming from a visit to the royal palace,
he devoutly gave him these two coins; his sole possession in
the world. The Buddha received them, and mercifully remembered
the donor, who (as Sakyamuni now explained) was richly
rewarded during ninety-one subsequent ages (W. u. Th., p. 53).
The widow's mite is no less closely reflected in the following
anecdote from the same collection. In the time of a former
Buddha, a certain monk belonging to his train had gone out
to collect the offerings of the pious. He arrived at the hut
of a miserable couple, who had nothing between them but
an old piece of cotton-wool. When the husband went out to
beg, the wife sat at home naked in the hay; and when the
wife went out, the husband remained in the same condition.
To these people then the monk approached, crying out as
usual, "Go and prostrate yourself before Buddha! present
him with gifts!" It happened that the wife was wearing the
cotton-wool on this occasion. She therefore requested the holy
man to wait a little, promising to return. Hereupon she entered
the house and requested the permission of her husband
to offer the cotton-wool to Buddha. He, however, pointed out
that as they had not the smallest property beyond this, extreme
inconvenience would result from the loss of it, for both of them
must then remain at home. To this she replied that they must
needs die in any case, and that their hopes for the future would
be much improved if they died after presentation of an offering.
She then returned to the monk, and requested him to turn
away his eyes a moment. But he told her to give her alms
openly in her hands, and that he would then recite a benediction
over them. The full delicacy of her situation had now to
be explained. "Except this cotton-wool stuff on my body I
have nothing, and no other clothing; since, then, it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344"> 344</span>
improper for thee to behold the foul-smelling impurity of the
female body, I will reach thee out the stuff from within." So
saying she retired into the house and handed out her garment.
When the monk delivered it to Buddha, it caused great offense
to the king's courtiers, who surrounded him, on account of its
being old and dirty. But Buddha, who knew their thoughts,
said, "I find, that of all the gifts of this assembly, no single
one surpasses this in cleanliness and purity" (W. u. Th., p. 150).</p>

<p>Not only in the case of the widow at the treasury did Jesus
dwell upon the value of even trifling gifts made for the sake
of religion. Another time he declared to those about him that
whoever gave them a cup of cold water in his name, because
they belonged to Christ, would not lose his reward. In Buddhist
story the very same ideas are to be found; almost the same
words. An eminent member of the Buddha's circle says that
"whoever with a purely-believing heart offers nothing but a
handful of water, or presents so much to the spiritual assembly
or to his parents, or gives drink therewith to the poor and
needy, or to a beast of the field;—this meritorious action will
not be exhausted in many ages" (W. u. Th., p. 37).</p>

<p>The simile of fishing for men, employed by Jesus in his
summons to Simon and Andrew, is likewise to be discovered in
the works of the great Asiatic religion. The images of the
Bodhisattvas, or Buddhas yet to come, frequently hold in
their hands a snare, which is thus explained in the <i>Nippon
Pantheon</i>:—"He disseminates upon the ocean of birth and decay
the Lotus-flower of the excellent law as bait; with the loop of
devotion, never cast out in vain, he brings living beings up like
fishes, and carries them to the other side of the river, where
there is true understanding" (B. T., p. 213). And in the book
from which some illustrations have already been taken, it is
said of a believer that "he had been seized by the hook of the
doctrine, just as a fish, who has taken the line, is securely
pulled out" (W. u. Th., p. 114).</p>

<p>Hitherto we have noticed a few of the minor points in the
doctrine of Jesus, and while there has been little in these to
object to, there has also been little to excite excessive admiration.
The extreme exaltation of humility, and the evident
anxiety to see, not equality of conditions, but a reversal of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345"> 345</span>
actual inequalities, are not among the best features of his ideal
system. We cannot but suspect something of a personal bias.
Thus, in the parable of the Pharisee and the publican, aimed
at a hostile and detested order, the publican is justified by nothing
but his humility; while in that of Lazarus and Dives, Lazarus
is eternally rewarded for nothing but his poverty. It is no
doubt well to be humble, and we should be glad to see poverty
removed; but it is not to be assumed that the Pharisee, conscious
of leading an honorable life, is therefore a bad man;
nor that the rich proprietor should be tormented in hell
merely because he does not give alms to all the beggars who
throng about his gates. When Jesus desires that virtuous
actions should be done as quietly and even as secretly as possible,
he inculcates an important principle of morals, and it is
devoutly to be wished that we had among us more of this unconspicuous
kindness, and less ostentatious charity. Where, however,
he preaches on the virtue of bestowing alms on his disciples,
he does but echo a sentiment which is natural to religious
teachers in all ages, and to which, as we have seen, the emissaries
of another and earlier faith, were equally alive. Passing
from these comparatively trifling questions, let us consider some
of his decisions on the greater moral problems with which he
felt called upon to deal.</p>

<p>On a vast social subject—that of divorce—he pronounced an
opinion which gives us a little insight into his mode of regarding
that most important of all topics, the relations of the sexes.
The Pharisees, it appears, came to him and asked him whether
it was permissible for a man to put away his wife, Moses having
allowed it. Jesus explained that this precept had been
given for the hardness of their hearts. His own view was, that
man and wife are one flesh, and that if either should leave the
other, except on account of unfaithfulness, and marry again,
that one would be guilty of adultery. This severe doctrine he
supported by one of his short sayings: "What God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder" (Mk. x. 1-12; Mt. xix. 1-12,
and v. 31, 32). But surely this judgment assumes the very point
at issue. The joining together in wedlock is ascribed to God;
the putting asunder to man. But granting the sacredness of
the marriage tie, it would still be no less possible to invoke the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346"> 346</span>
divine sanction for its dissolution than for its original formation.
And in many instances the maxim might be exactly
reversed. So unfortunate is the result of many marriages,
that it would be easy for a religious reformer to say of them,
with perfect sincerity, "What man hath joined together, let
God put asunder." There is, in fact, almost as much to be said
on moral grounds for the divorce of unhappy couples as for the
marriage of happy ones. Nor does Jesus by any means face the
real difficulties of the question by allowing divorce where either
of the parties has been guilty of adultery. This, no doubt, is
the extreme case, and if divorce is not to be given here, it can
be given nowhere. But why is adultery to be the sole ground
of separation? Why is an institution which may bring so much
happiness to mankind to be converted into one of the most fertile
sources of human misery? Why, when both parties to the
contract desire separation, is an external authority, whether
that of opinion or of law, to enforce union? None of these
questions appear to have presented themselves to the mind of
Jesus. Supposing even that his decision were right, he assigns
no reasons for it, but simply lays down the law in a trenchant
manner, without giving us the least clue to the process by
which he arrived at so strange a conclusion. Nor is it in the
least likely that the many perplexities encompassing this, and
all other questions affecting the morals of sex, had ever troubled
him. His mind was not sufficiently subtle to enter into them;
and thus it is that, throughout the whole course of his career,
he lays down no single doctrine (if we except this one on
divorce) which can be of the smallest service to his disciples in
the many practical troubles that must beset their lives from
the existence of a natural passion of which he takes no account.</p>

<p>Another weak point in the system of Jesus is his aversion to
wealth and wealthy men, apart from the consideration of the
good or bad use they may make of their property. Thus, the
only advice he gives to the rich man who had kept all the
commandments was to sell everything he had and give the proceeds
to the poor; a measure of very questionable advantage to
those for whose benefit it is intended. When the man naturally
declined to take this course—practically a mere throwing off of
the responsibilities of life—Jesus remarked that it was hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347"> 347</span>
for those who had riches to enter the kingdom of God. Seeing
the amazement of his disciples, he emphasized his doctrine by
adding that it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye
of a needle than for a rich man to enter that kingdom. Hereupon
his disciples, "excessively astonished," asked who then
could be saved, and Jesus left a loophole for the salvation of
the rich by the declaration that, impossible as it might be for
men to pass a camel through a needle's eye, all things are possible
with God (Mk. x. 17-27). A like <i>animus</i> against the wealthier
classes is evinced in the story of the king who invited a
number of guests to a wedding festivity. Those who had received
invitations made light of them, one going to his farm, another
to his merchandise, and so forth; or, according to another version,
alleging their worldly affairs as excuses. Seeing that they
would not come, the king bade his servants go out into the
highways, and bring in whomsoever they might find; or, as
Luke puts it, the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind
(Mt. xxii. 1-10; Lu. xiv. 16-24).</p>

<p>More indiscriminately still is this aversion to the rich expressed
in the parable of Lazarus and Dives. Here we are not
told that the great proprietor had been a bad man, or had acted
with any unusual selfishness. The utmost we may infer from
the language used about him is that he had not been sufficiently
sensitive to the difference between his own condition and that
of the beggar. But no positive unkindness is even hinted at.
Nor had the beggar done anything to merit reward. He had
only led one of those idle and worthless lives of dependence on
others which are too common among Southern nations. Yet in
the future life the beggar appears to be rewarded merely because
in this life he had been badly off; and the rich man is
punished merely because he had been well off (Lu. xvi. 19-25).
A stronger instance of apparently irrational prejudice it would
be difficult to find.</p>

<p>In connection with these notions about wealth there is a
curious theory of social intercourse deserving to be considered.
Jesus has expressed it thus: "When thou makest a supper or a
dinner, do not invite thy friends, or thy brothers, or thy relations,
or thy rich neighbors, lest they also should invite thee in
return, and thou shouldst have a recompense. But when thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348"> 348</span>
makest a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the
blind; and thou shalt be blessed because they have not the
means of making thee a recompense. For thou shalt be recompensed
at the resurrection of the just" (Lu. xiv. 12-14). Nobody
can object to charitable individuals asking poor people or
invalids without rank to dinner at their houses; indeed, it is to
be wished that the practice were more common than it is. But
we cannot admit that this kind action ought to be rendered obligatory,
to the exclusion of other modes of conduct. Society,
properly speaking, cannot exist except by reciprocity. That
sort of friendly intercourse between equals which constitutes
society implies giving and taking; and it is eminently desirable
that we should do exactly what Christ would forbid us
doing, namely, invite our neighbors and be invited by them as
circumstances may require. The fear that we may receive a
recompense for the dinner-parties we may give is surely chimerical.
Pleasantness and mutual advantage are alike promoted by
this reciprocity, which, moreover, avoids the discomfort produced
when the obligation is wholly on one side. Jesus, in
fact, overlooks entirely the more intellectual side of society,
and dwells exclusively on the moral side. What he wishes to
establish, is not converse between men, but charity. So that a
person acting on his views would be excluded from the society
of those who might benefit him either materially or morally,
and would be confined to those whom he might benefit. Such
an arrangement would not in the end be good either for the
benefactors or the benefited.</p>

<p>His conceptions of justice are seemingly not more perfect than
his conceptions of social arrangements. The parable of the laborers
is intended to justify the deity in assigning equal rewards
to those who have borne unequal burdens, and also to illustrate
his doctrine that the first will be last, and the last first. A
householder hires a number of laborers to work in his vineyard;
some of whom he engages in the morning, others later in the
day, others towards its close. All of them receive a denarium
in payment, though some had worked the whole day, and others
only an hour. At this result the class which had worked the
longer time grumble; but the householder defends himself by
appealing to the strict terms of his contract, by which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349"> 349</span>
bound himself to give the same wages to all (Mt. xx. 1-16). No
doubt the laborers who had borne the burden and heat of the
day had no <i>legal</i> standing-point for their complaint; but the
sentiment that prompted it was none the less a just one. Granting
the validity of the master's plea that he had honorably fulfilled
his bargain, it may still be urged that the bargain itself
was not of an equitable character. Plainly, a sum which is adequate
pay for an hour, is inadequate for ten or twelve; and
that which is sufficient for a day is excessive for an evening.
And the same argument applies to a future state. If, as is so
often urged, it is to be a compensation for the sufferings of this
state, then it ought to bear some proportion to those sufferings.
But how can this be effected? Jesus saw the difficulty, and
endeavored, but not successfully, to meet it by this parable.</p>

<p>But the imperfection of his sense of justice is nowhere more
conspicuously shown than in the conduct he ascribes to God.
To recur again to the case of Lazarus and Dives. Not only is
the rich man punished with frightful torture, but his humble
and kindly request that Lazarus might be allowed to warn his
five brothers of their possible fate is met with a peremptory
refusal. The only reason alleged for this cruelty is that they
have Moses and the prophets, who certainly did not inform
them that the mere possession of wealth or enjoyment of luxury
was punished by everlasting misery (Lu. xvi. 27-31). In other
places, too, the horrible doctrine of unending punishment is
asserted by Jesus, and all the efforts of his modern disciples
will not explain away this fact. The tares are to be bound up
in bundles to be burnt. The wicked are to be cast into a furnace
of fire, where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth
(Mt. xiii. 30, 42, 50). It is better to enter into life mutilated than
to be thrown unmutilated into the fire (Mt. xviii. 8, 9) of hell
which is never quenched (Mk. ix. 43-46). The servant who had
made no money by usury is cast into outer darkness (Mt. xxv.
30). The righteous go into eternal life; the wicked to eternal
punishment (Mt. xxv. 46). Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
cannot be forgiven, but involves eternal damnation (Mk. iii. 29).
It is almost needless to observe that no wickedness could ever
justify punishment without an end; that is, punishment for
punishment's sake; and that the creation of human beings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350"> 350</span>
whose existence <i>terminated</i> in torture would be itself a far more
terrible crime than any which the basest of mankind can ever
commit.</p>

<p>There is one more point as to which his teaching will not
bear investigation. It is the doctrine of the power of prayer.
He tells his hearers, in the most absolute manner, that they
will receive whatever they may ask in prayer, provided they
believe (Mk. xi. 24; Mt. xxi. 22). Faith is the grand and sole
condition of the accomplishment of all desires. This is the explanation
of the withered fig-tree. It was faith that had wrought
the change. By faith the disciples might effect not only such
matters as the destruction of fig-trees, but far more stupendous
miracles (Mt. xxi. 19-21). This is the explanation of the disciples'
failure with the lunatic child. It was owing to their want
of faith. Had they but faith as a grain of mustard seed—so
Jesus told them—they would be able to say to a mountain,
"Remove hence thither," and it would be removed. Nothing
would be impossible to them (Mt. xvii. 20). And if they had
faith themselves, if they really believed in their master's words,
and ever attempted the experiment of working such transformations
in nature, they must have experienced the bitter disappointment
so graphically described by the authoress of "Joshua
Davidson" in the case of that sincere Christian. But short of
this extreme trial of the power of faith over matter, many generations
of pious believers will bear sad witness to the fact that
they have asked many things in prayer which they have <i>not</i>
received; not least among the number being moral excellence,
which they have but imperfectly attained. Yet this, it would
seem, might be the most easily granted without interference
with the physical universe. And if it be pleaded that no Christian
has ever really succeeded in acquiring the degree of faith
required to move mountains, what becomes of the promise of
Jesus? Is it not a mere form of words, depending for its truth
on a condition which human nature never can fulfill?</p>

<p>The opinions of Jesus on the question of the lawfulness of
the tribute, and his reply to the Sadducean difficulty about due
adjustment of matrimonial relations in a future state, have been
already noticed. Neither of these decisions, it has been shown,
can be regarded as evincing wisdom or depth of thought. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351"> 351</span>
the other hand, his answer to the scribe who asked him which
was the first commandment fully deserves the approbation
which his questioner bestowed. After this, remarks the Evangelist
triumphantly, no man dared to interrogate him. Passing
from these isolated judgments, let us consider now the fullest
exposition to be found anywhere of the moral system of Jesus,—the
so-called Sermon on the Mount (Mt. v.-vii. inclusive). As
reported by Matthew, this is a vast collection of precepts on
many different subjects, delivered no doubt on many different
occasions. Taken together, they contain the concentrated
essence of his teaching, and offer therefore the fairest field for
discussion and criticism. He opens his discourse with a series
of blessings, in which his extreme fondness for contrasting the
present with the future order is markedly exhibited. Those
whom he selects as the objects of benediction are the poor in
spirit; mourners; the meek; those who hunger and thirst
after righteousness; the merciful; the pure in heart; the peace-makers;
those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake; the
disciples when reviled, persecuted, and unjustly accused. Of the
nine classes of those who are thus blessed, five are composed
of those whose present condition makes them objects of pity,
and who are consoled with the assurance that they shall be
rewarded in the kingdom of heaven. After this, the followers
of Jesus are admonished that they are the salt of the earth,
and that they must cause their light to shine before men. This
is followed by that remarkable declaration (already noticed) as
to the permanence of the law, and by a warning that, if they
wished to enter the kingdom of heaven, their righteousness
must exceed that of those odious people, the scribes and Pharisees.</p>

<p>Hereupon Jesus takes up three great commandments—not to
kill, not to commit adultery, not to commit perjury—and proceeds
to expand their meaning beyond the literal signification
of the words. Thus, it had been said, "Thou shalt not kill."
But he says, that whoever is angry with his brother shall be
liable to the judgment; that whoever says "Raka" to his
brother shall be liable to the Sanhedrim; but that whoever
says "Fool," shall be liable to hell, or literally, to "the
gehenna of fire." The punishment is of undue severity in pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352"> 352</span>portion
to the offense; but when, in the following verses, Jesus
insists on the importance of doing justice to men before performing
religious obligations, he speaks in the truest spirit of
humanity. Proceeding to the commandment not to commit
adultery, he enjoins an excess of self-discipline. It is <i>not</i> desirable
to pluck out the right eye and cut off the right hand
because they offend us, though it is well to train them to obey
the higher faculties. The argument of Jesus rests only on the
assumption that the sinful members, if not destroyed by such
violent measures as this, may land the whole body in hell.
Dealing next with the question of oaths, he enlarges the prohibition
of perjury into a prohibition of all swearing whatsoever,
assigning the strangest reasons for avoiding the employment,
when taking oaths, of the names of various objects. They are
not to swear by heaven, because it is God's throne; nor by the
earth, because it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it
is the city of the great king; nor by the head, because we cannot
make a single hair black or white. Granting even that the
advice is good, what is to be said of these reasons? What
would be thought of a Member of Parliament using an exactly
parallel argument: namely, that it is wrong to swear by the
New Testament, because the person taking the oath cannot
make a single type larger or smaller?</p>

<p>The theory embodied in the following verses occupies so
cardinal a place in the philosophy of Jesus, that in order to do
him justice they must be quoted at length. "You have heard
that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
But I tell you not to resist evil; but whoever shall smite thee
on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And as for him
who wishes to sue thee, and take thy coat, give him thy cloak
also. And whoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go two
with him. Give to him that asketh thee; and turn not away
from him that wishes to borrow of thee. You have heard that
it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for
them who persecute you, that you may be sons of your father
in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on bad and good, and
sends rain on just and unjust" (Mt. v. 38-45).</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no single point in the moral teaching of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353"> 353</span>
Jesus which has been more celebrated than this. It is thought
to represent the very acme of perfection, and Christianity takes
credit to itself for the embodiment of so magnificent a doctrine
in its moral system. And certainly the words of Jesus are so
sublime as almost to extort admiration and disarm criticism.
Nor would it at all detract from his merits if the principle here
laid down should turn out to be no new discovery of his own,
but one already reached by great teachers in other lands; for
it was through him that it was made known to the Jews of his
own age, and thus to the whole of Christendom. Moreover, we
cannot suppose that he had ever heard of those who had anticipated
the sentiments, and almost the words, of these beautiful
sentences in the Sermon on the Mount. Nevertheless, these
anticipations exist; and whatever glory this rule may confer on
the religion of Christ must belong equally, and even by prior
right, to the religion of Lao-tsze and the religion of Buddha.
Thus Lao-tsze says, "Return enmity by doing good" (T. t. k.,
63). Or again, "I treat the good man well; the man who is
not good I also treat well" (Ibid., 49). The very perfection of
patience under injustice, extending to the length of blessing
those who curse, and turning the other cheek to those who
smite the one—is exhibited in the old Buddhistic legend of
Pûrna. Pûrna is a convert who spontaneously betakes himself as
a missionary to a savage nation. The Buddha asks him what he
will do if they address him in coarse and insolent language.
He replies that he will consider them good and gentle people
not to strike him with their fists or stone him. Should they
strike him with their fists or stone him, he will still think them
good and gentle neither to strike him with sticks or swords;
should they strike him with sticks or swords, he will equally
praise them for not killing him; should they even kill him, he
will still say, "They are certainly good people, they are certainly
gentle people, they who deliver me with so little pain
from this body full of impurity" (H. B. I., p. 253). This is certainly
a most consistent application of the principle of non-resistance
to evil, and of loving one's enemies. No Christian
saint or martyr could have followed his master's precepts more
faithfully than this Buddhist apostle. But whether those precepts
admit of general adoption into the scheme of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354"> 354</span>
morals is a much more difficult question than whether in occasional
instances here and there they have led to admirable conduct.
Let us call in another Chinese philosopher to our assistance
on this point.</p>

<p>The doctrine of returning good for evil, proclaimed, as we
have seen, by Lao-tsze, was thus dealt with by his great rival,
Confucius. "Some one said, 'What do you say concerning the
principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?'
The Master said, 'With what, then, will you recompense kindness?
Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness
with kindness.'" How shall we decide between these
authorities? None can question the nobility of the conduct
enjoined by Jesus in certain instances. There are cases where
the return of good for evil, of blessing for cursing, of benevolence
for persecution, is not only the highest practicable virtue,
but also the best punishment of the evil-doers. Nevertheless,
there is great force in the observations of Confucius. If we are
to reward injury by kindness, how are we to reward kindness?
Is there to be no difference made between those who do us
good and those who do us harm? To so pertinent a question
we are compelled to answer that the practical results of such
conduct on our part would be simply disastrous. Unkindness
would not receive its natural and appropriate penalty, nor kindness
its natural and appropriate reward. Not only should we
ourselves be losers by our failure to resist injustice, but the
worst classes of mankind would receive by that non-resistance
a powerful stimulus to evil. Imagine, for example, that, instead
of opposing an extortionate claim, we give up our cloak
also to the man who wishes to take our coat. Plainly such
conduct can have but one result. We shall become the victims
of extortionate claims, and our property will be squandered
among the undeserving instead of being kept for better uses.
Or suppose that persecution for the sake of our opinions, instead
of being met with armed resistance, wherever that resistance
is likely to be successful, is received only with blessings
showered on the heads of the oppressors; without doubt, the
hands of the persecuting party will be strengthened, and liberty,
which is everywhere the result of resisting evil, will never
be established. The freedom we ourselves enjoy, both as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355"> 355</span>
nation in respect of other nations, and as individuals in respect
of our domestic government, is the consequence of acting on a
principle the direct reverse of that laid down by Jesus. Our
ancestors, who were good Christians but much better patriots,
would have been amazed indeed at any attempt to persuade
them to turn the left cheek to him who smote them on the
right. A doctrine more convenient for the purposes of tyrants
and malefactors of every description it would be difficult to
invent.</p>

<p>At the same time it must be conceded that there is in it
some truth, provided we discriminate between fitting and unfitting
occasions for its application. It is not the violent man
who assaults us, the unscrupulous man who sues us, or the persecutor
who tramples on our freedom, who should be met by a
benevolent return. But there are offenses of so personal a
nature, affecting our individual interest so largely, and the public
interest so slightly, that the best way of dealing with them
may often be not to resent them, but to receive them with unruffled
gentleness. Each person must judge for himself what
are the cases to which this possibility applies. But the guiding
rule in thus acting must be that we expect by thus returning
good for evil to soften the heart of him who has done us
wrong, and in the language of Paul to "heap coals of fire on
his head." Should the effect be simply to relieve him from the
penalty of our resentment without inducing him to change his
course, we shall have done him a moral injury and society a
material injury, and the probability or improbability of such
result should be measured in deciding upon the conduct to be
pursued. Properly guarded, and borne in mind as the occasional
exception, by no means as the rule, the return of injustice
or ill-will by benevolence and kindly feeling may be of the
utmost value, both in cultivating the best emotions in those
who practice it, and in calling forth the repentance of those
towards whom it is practiced; but as a universal and absolute
principle it must be utterly rejected. Lao-tsze and Jesus when
they affirmed it undoubtedly struck one of the highest notes in
human nature. Yet it must be granted that Khung-tsze took a
wider view, and that his injunction to recompense injury with
justice, and kindness with kindness, is more consistent with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356"> 356</span>
philosophic regard for the interests of mankind, and with a
practicable scheme of social ethics.</p>

<p>Jesus proceeds to enjoin his disciples neither to give alms,
nor to pray, nor to fast in an ostentatious manner; and in connection
with this excellent advice he teaches them the short
prayer which has become so famous under his name. The
clauses of this prayer may be worth some consideration. It
begins with a formula of adoration addressed to "Our father in
heaven." Then follows a petition full of meaning to Jesus and
those to whom he imparted it, but of little or no signification
in the mouths of the millions of modern Christians who daily
repeat it: "Thy kingdom come." Jesus hoped, and his disciples
caught the hope, that God's kingdom would come very
soon; and this prayer was a request for the early realization of
the glories of that kingdom. Those who then employed it believed
that at any moment it might be granted, and that at no
distant period it certainly would be granted. "Thy will be
done, as in heaven so also on earth;" a clause embodying the
popular conception of another region in which God's will is
perfectly obeyed, while here it is met by some counteracting
influence. "Give us this day our daily bread," for beyond the
daily provision they were not to look; a doctrine which we
shall notice shortly. "And forgive us our debts" (or, in Luke,
our sins) "as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil." Passing over the singular
conception of God as leading men into temptation, let us
rather notice the preceding petition, on which Jesus himself has
supplied a commentary, that we may be forgiven, as we forgive
others. In reference to this he tells his hearers, that if they
forgive men their trespasses, their heavenly father will forgive
theirs; and that if they do not thus behave, neither will he.
A kindred doctrine is laid down in the beginning of the next
chapter, where he tells them not to judge, that they may not
be judged; that with what measure they mete, it shall be measured
to them again. And this illustrated in another place by
the parable of the servant who, having been excused from the
immediate payment of a large debt by his master, refused to
excuse a fellow-servant from the payment of a small one;
whereupon his master flew into a passion, and "delivered him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357"> 357</span>
to the tormentors" (Mt. xviii. 23-35). There is an apparent justice
and real emotional satisfaction in the harsh treatment of
those who are harsh themselves. But we must not be misled
by the immediate gratification we experience at the punishment
of the unforgiving servant, supposing that it is right to mete
out to each man the measure he metes out to others. Assuredly
it does not follow that because a man is unjust or cruel, he
should be treated with injustice or cruelty himself. Either it is
right to forgive a man's sins, or it is not. If right, then his
own harshness in refusing forgiveness to another is one of the
sins which should be forgiven. If not right, then neither that
nor any other offense should be forgiven by the supreme dispenser
of justice. For what reason should the one crime of not
forgiving those who trespass against us be selected for a punishment
of such extraordinary severity, while it is implied that
the penalty of other and graver crimes may by God's mercy be
remitted? The fact is, that Jesus is misled by a false analogy
between the conduct of one man towards another, in a case
where he is personally concerned, and the conduct of a judge
towards criminals. Offenses against morality are treated as personal
offenses against God, who has therefore the same right to
forgive them as a creditor has to excuse his debtor from payment.
But in a perfect system of justice, human or divine,
there could be no question of forgiveness at all. Every violation
of the law would bring its appropriate penalty, <i>and no
more</i>. The penalty being thus proportioned to the offense, there
could be no question of that sort of "forgiveness" which implies
a suspicion that it is, or may be, too severe. No doubt,
the temper of the offender, and the probability of his repeating
the crime, would be elements to be considered in awarding the
sentence. But it must always be borne in mind that either the
hope of complete pardon, or the threat of a punishment far
heavier than is needed to deter, equally tend to neutralize the
effects of our system of justice. And thus it has been in Christendom.
The threat of everlasting torture, accompanied with
the expectation of complete forgiveness, has been less efficacious
than would have been the most moderate of earthly penalties,
provided they had been certain. But Jesus was encumbered
with a system in which there were no gradations. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358"> 358</span>
he represents the deity now as extending complete forgiveness
to sins which should have received their fitting retribution; now
as visiting with immoderate severity offenses for which more
lenient measures would have amply sufficed.</p>

<p>Proceeding to another subject, the speaker dwells upon the
comparative unimportance of terrestrial affairs. He advises
men not to lay up treasure on earth, but in heaven, for where
their treasure is, there will their heart be also; and he goes
on to say, "Take no thought for your life what you shall eat
or what you shall drink, nor for your body what you shall put
on. Is not the life more than nourishment, and the body than
raiment? Look at the birds of the sky, for they sow not,
neither do they reap nor gather into barns, and your heavenly
father feeds them. Are you not much better than they? And
which of you by taking thought can add a single cubit to his
stature? And why do you take thought for raiment? Consider
the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin: and
I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed
like one of these. And if God so clothe the grass of the field
which exists to-day and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will he
not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?" Therefore
his disciples are to take no thought about eating, drinking, or
clothing (as the Gentiles do), for their heavenly father knows
that they have need of these things. They are to seek the
kingdom of God and his righteousness, and these will be added.
They are to take no thought for the morrow, but let the morrow
take thought for itself (Mt. vi. 25-34). Upon which extraordinary
argument it would have been interesting to ask a few
questions. In the first place, how did Jesus suppose that it
had happened that men had in fact come to trouble themselves
about food, drink, and clothing? Did he imagine that an inherent
pleasure in labor had driven them to do so? Would he
not rather have been compelled to admit that, not by any
choice of their own, but just because their heavenly father had
<i>not</i> provided these things in the requisite abundance, they had
been forced to "take thought" for the morrow, all their primitive
inclinations notwithstanding? Every tendency of human
nature would have prompted men to take no thought either for
food or raiment, had not hunger and cold brought vividly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359"> 359</span>fore
them the necessity of doing so. But for this they would
only have been too glad to live like the birds of the air or the
lilies of the field. But let us examine a little more closely the
reasoning of Jesus. Birds neither sow nor reap; God feeds
them; therefore he will feed us without sowing or reaping. A
more unfortunate illustration of the care of Providence for his
creatures it would be difficult to find. Was Jesus ignorant of
the fact that he feeds some birds upon others whom they seize
on as their prey, and these again upon an inferior class of animals?
So that, if he is careful of the hawk, it is at the expense
of the dove; and if he is careful of the sparrow, it is at the
expense of the worm. Cannibalism, or at least a recourse to
wild animals as the only obtainable diet, must have been the
logical results of the doctrine of Jesus. Not less singular would
be the effects of his teaching as to clothes. The lily which remains
in a state of nature is more beautifully arrayed than was
Solomon. Granted; but does it therefore follow that we are to
imitate the lily? We might agree with Jesus that nudity, alike
in flowers and in human beings, is more beautiful than the
most superb dressing: yet there are conveniences in clothes
which may even justify taking a little thought in order to obtain
them, and those who really omit to do this are generally the
lowest types of the human race. That God would not give us
clothing if we ourselves made no effort to obtain it, is not only
admitted, but almost asserted, in the argument of Jesus; for
he refers us to the grass of the field, which remains in its natural
condition, as an example of the kind of raiment which our
heavenly father provides. So absurd are these precepts, that
no body of Christians has ever attempted to act upon them.
Some there have been, indeed, who took no thought for the
morrow, and who never exerted themselves to procure the
necessaries of life. But then they lived in the midst of societies
where these things were provided by the labor of others, and
where they well knew that their pious indolence would not
leave them a prey to hunger, but would rather stimulate the
charitable zeal of their more secular brethren.</p>

<p>After laying down the rule against judging others, which has
been already referred to, Jesus gives the excellent advice to
those who would pull the mote out of their brother's eye to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360"> 360</span>
attend first to the beam in their own. This is followed by the
proverbial warning not to cast pearls before swine. A singular
passage succeeds, in which the doctrine is broadly stated that
whatever men desire of God they are to ask it, "for every one
who asks receives, and he who seeks finds." And it is added,
that as they give their children good gifts, so their heavenly
father gives good things to those who ask him. But what of
those who do not ask him? Does he, like an unwise human
parent, give most to those who are the loudest in their petitions,
neglecting the humble or retiring children who make no noise?
These verses allow us no option but to suppose that Jesus
thought he did, and this inference receives strong confirmation
from the parable of the unjust judge, who yielded to clamor
what he would not give from a sense of justice (Lu. xviii. 1-5),
as also from the illustration of the man who was wearied by
the importunity of his friend into doing what he would not have
done for the sake of friendship (Lu. xi. 5-9). In the former case,
the parable is related for the express purpose of showing "that
men ought always to pray and not to faint;" in the latter, the
illustration is given in connection with the very verses which
we are now criticising. There is, then, no escape from the conclusion
that the conceptions Jesus had of the deity were of a
nature to lead to the belief that God might be worried by continual
prayer into concessions and favors which would not otherwise
have been granted.</p>

<p>Excepting a single verse, the remainder of the sermon is
occupied with a warning that the way to life is narrow, that to
destruction broad; with a caution against false prophets, and a
very fine description of the future rejection from heaven of
many who have made loud professions of religion, and contrariwise,
of the reception of those who have done their father's
will, and whom he likens to one who has built his house upon
the solid rock as distinguished from one who has built it on
the sand. One verse, however, remains, and that not only the
most important in the whole of this discourse, but ethically the
most important in the whole of its author's system. That verse
is the well-known commandment: "All things whatsoever you
may wish men to do to you, thus also do you to them. For
this is the law and the prophets" (Mt. vii. 12; Lu. vi. 31).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361"> 361</span>
Whether Jesus perceived that in this brief sentence he was
enunciating the cardinal principle of all morality is of necessity
uncertain. But from the addition of the phrase "this is the
law and the prophets," it is probable that he regarded it as a
summary of the moral teachings of the religion he professed.
If so, he has rightly laid the foundation of scientific ethics.
Utilitarians, who believe that the object of morality is human
happiness, may claim him (as one of them has already done) as
the father of their system. While Kant, who gives the fundamental
law, so to act that the rule of your conduct may be
such as you yourself would wish to see adopted as a general
principle, will be equally in agreement with him. Nor does it
detract from the merits of Jesus that this very doctrine should
have been announced in China about five centuries before he
proclaimed it in Judea. He remains not less original; but we,
while giving him his due, must be careful to award an equal
tribute to his great predecessor, Confucius. Twice over did
that eminent man assert the principle taught in the Sermon
on the Mount. In the first instance, "Chung-kung
asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, 'It is, when you
go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a
great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a
great sacrifice; <i>not to do to others as you would not wish done to
yourself</i>; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and
none in the family'" (C. C., vol. i. p. 115.—Lun Yu, xii. 2).
Much more strikingly is this law enunciated in the second case.
"Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'Is there one word which may serve
as a rule of practice for all one's life?' The Master said, 'Is
not <span class="allsmcap">RECIPROCITY</span> such a word? What you do not want done to
yourself, do not do to others'" (C. C., vol. i. p. 165.—Lun Yu,
xv. 23). And we have another statement of the rule in the work
ascribed to the grandson of Confucius, where he is reported to
have said, "What you do not like when done to yourself, do
not do to others" (Chung Yung, xiii. 3.—C. C., vol. i. p. 258). It is
true, as remarked by the translator, that the doctrine is here
stated negatively, and not positively; but practically this can
make little difference in its application. Not to do to others
what we wish them not to do to us would amount to nearly the
same thing as doing what we wish them to do. Obviously it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362"> 362</span>
prohibits all actual injury which we should resent if inflicted on
ourselves. But it also enjoins active benevolence; for as we do
not like the lack of kindness towards ourselves when in distress
or want, so we must not be guilty of showing such lack of kindness
to others. Take the parable of the good Sâmaritan, told
in illustration of the kindred maxim to love our neighbors as
ourselves. Plainly we should not like the conduct of the priest
and the Levite were we in the situation of the plundered man.
And if so, the behavior of the good Sâmaritan is that which
the Chinese as well as the Jewish prophet would require us to
pursue.</p>

<p>Much more might be said of the doctrines of Jesus, but it is
time to bring this over-long section to a close. What answer
shall we now return to the query which stands at the head of
this final division? What are we to think of him? Is our judgment
to be mainly favorable or mainly unfavorable? or must
it be a mixture of opposing sentiments? The reply may be
given under three separate heads, relating the one to his work
as a prophet, the next to his intellectual, and the last to his
moral character. Considered as a prophet, he forms one of a
mighty triad who divide among them the honor of having
given their religions to the larger portion of Asia and to the
whole of Europe. Confucius, to whom Eastern Asia owes its
most prevalent faith; Buddha Sakyamuni, whose faith is
accepted in the south and centre of that continent; and Christ,
to whom Europe bows the knee, are the members of this great
trinity not in unity. All three are alike in their possession of
prophetic ardor and prophetic inspiration. Two of them, the
Chinaman and the Jew, speak as the conscious agents of a
higher Power. The other, of whom his creed prevents us from
saying this, is yet represented in his story as predestined to a
great mission, becoming aware of that destiny at a certain
epoch of his life, and thenceforth feeling that no temptations
and no sufferings can induce him to swerve from his allotted
task. Of these three men it would perhaps be accurate to say
that Confucius was the most thoughtful, Sakyamuni the most
eminently virtuous, and Christ the most deeply religious. Not
that a description like this can be regarded as exhaustive.
Each trespasses to some degree on the special domain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363"> 363</span>
others. Especially is it hard to compare the moral excellence
of Jesus with that of Buddha. The Hindu, as depicted in his
biographies, offers a character of singular beauty, and free
from some of the defects which may be discerned in that of
the Jew. History, however, was too much despised by these
Oriental sectaries to enable us to form a trustworthy comparison.
All we can affirm is, that, assuming the pictures of both
prophets to be correctly drawn, there is in Sakyamuni a purity
of tone, an absence of violence or rancor, an exemption from
personal feeling and from hostile bias, which place him even on
a higher level than his Jewish fellow-prophet. Supposing, on
the other hand, that either picture is not historical, then it
must be conceded that primitive Buddhism attained a more
perfect ideal of goodness than primitive Christianity. Both
ideals, however, are admirable, and they closely resemble one
another.</p>

<p>Morally not unlike, Jesus and Sakyamuni have another
point of similarity in a certain mournfulness of spirit, a sorrowing
regret for the errors of human kind, and a tender anxiety
to summon them from those errors to a better way. Each
in his own manner felt that life was very sad; each desired to
relieve that sadness, though each aimed at effecting his end by
different means. Sakyamuni offered to his disciples the peace
of Nirvâna; Jesus, the favor of God and the rewards to be given
in his kingdom. There is a striking similarity in the manner
in which the summons to suffering humanity is expressed in
each religion. Here are the words ascribed to Buddha: "Many,
driven by fear, seek an asylum in mountains and in woods, in
hermitages and in the neighborhood of sacred trees. But
it is not the best asylum, it is not the best refuge, and it is not
in that asylum that men are delivered from every pain. He, on
the contrary, who seeks a refuge in Buddha, in the Law and in
the Assembly, when he perceives with wisdom the four sublime
truths, ... that man knows the best asylum, the best
refuge; as soon as he has reached it, he is delivered from every
pain" (H. B. I., p. 186). Still more beautifully is the like sentiment
expressed by Jesus: "Come unto me, all ye that labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364"> 364</span>
and you shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy
and my burden is light" (Mt. xi. 28-30).</p>

<p>While in tenderness and sympathy for human sorrow Christ
resembles Buddha, in the nature of his moral precepts he sometimes
resembles Confucius. The plain duties of man towards
his fellow-man are inculcated in the same spirit by both, while
in Buddhism it is generally the most extreme and often prodigious
examples of charity or self-sacrifice that are held up to
admiration. Buddhism, moreover, teaches by means of long
stories; Confucius and Jesus by means of short maxims. To a
certain extent, indeed, Jesus combines both methods, the first
being represented in his parables; but these are much simpler,
and go far more directly to the point, than the complicated
narratives of the Buddhistic canon. On the whole, we may
safely say that Jesus is certainly not surpassed by either of
these rival prophets, and that in some respects, if not in all,
he surpasses both.</p>

<p>Another comparison is commonly made, and may be just
touched on here. It is that between the Hebrew prophet and
the Athenian sage, "who," in the words of Byron, "lived and
died as none can live or die." Without fully endorsing this
emphatic opinion of the poet, we may admit that Socrates is
not unworthy to stand beside Jesus in the foremost rank of the
heroes of our race. He shares with the prophets who have been
already named the inspiring sense of a divine mission which
he is bound to fulfill. At all hazards and under all conditions
he will carry on the special and peculiar work which the divine
voice commands him to do. And this plenary belief in his own
inspiration is not accompanied, as sometimes happens, by mental
poverty. Intellectually his superiority to Jesus cannot be
disputed. It is apparent in the very manner of his instruction.
Socrates could never have enunciated the truths he had to tell
in that authoritative tone which is appropriate to the religious
teacher. Whatever knowledge he thinks it possible to acquire
at all must be acquired by reasoning and inquiry; and must be
tested by comparison of our own mental condition with that of
others. Nothing must be assumed but what is granted by the
hearer. Socrates would have thought that there was little
gained by the mere dogmatic assertion of moral or spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365"> 365</span>
truths. He must carry his interlocutor along with him; must
compel him to admit his errors; must stimulate his desire of
improvement by bringing him face to face with his own ignorance.
Much as we must value the moral teaching of Christ, it
must be confessed that the peculiar gift of Socrates is one of a
far rarer kind. The power of inculcating holiness, purity, charity,
and other virtues, either directly by short maxims (as in
the Confucian Analects, in Mencius, or in Marcus Aurelius), or
indirectly by stories (as in Buddhagosha's parables), is by no
means so uncommon as the Socratic gift of searching examination
into men's minds and souls. If Jesus is unsurpassed in the
former—"primus inter pares"—Socrates is absolutely without
a rival in the latter.</p>

<p>Whether the shock of the <i>elenchus</i> of Socrates, or the touching
beauty of the parables and the Sermon on the Mount, produced
the greatest benefit to the hearers is a question that can
hardly be determined. The effect of either method must depend
upon the character of those to whom it is applied. Outward
appearances would lead us to assign more influence to the method
of Jesus; for Socrates left no Socratics, while Christ did leave
Christians to hand on his doctrine. But, in the first place, it
may be confidently asserted that no lasting sect could have been
formed upon the basis of the few truths taught by Jesus himself;
and, in the second place, the fact that he became the
founder of a new religion must be attributed as much to the
state of Judea at the time as to his personal influence. That
the influence of Socrates was not small in his own life-time
might be inferred from the bitterness of the prosecution alone,
even if Plato had not remained to attest the abiding impress he
left upon an intellect by the side of which those of Peter,
James, and John, are but as little children to a full-grown
athlete. We can imagine the havoc that would have been made
in the statements and arguments of Jesus had Socrates met him
face to face and subjected him to his testing method. How ill
would his loose popular notions have borne a close examination
of their foundations; how easily would his dogmatic assertions
have been exposed in all their naked presumption by a few simple
questions; how quickly would his careless reasoning have
been shattered by the dialectic art which would have forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366"> 366</span>
him to exhibit its fallacies himself before the assembled audience!
But there was no one competent to the task, and when
his opponents attempted to perplex him by what they thought
awkward questions, he was able to baffle them without much
trouble by his superior skill.</p>

<p>It is not, however, as an intellectual man that we must consider
Jesus. He himself laid no claim to the character, and, if
we would do him justice, we must judge him by his own idea
of his function and his duties. So judging, there can be no
question that we must recognize in him a man of the highest
moral grandeur, lofty in his aims, pure in his use of means,
earnest, energetic, zealous, and unselfish. No doubt he was
sometimes misled by that very ardor which inspired him with
the courage required to pursue his work. No doubt he suffered
himself to forget the charity that was due to those who could
not accept his mission nor bow before his preaching. No doubt
he returned curse for curse, and hatred for hatred, with unsparing hand.
Perhaps, too, he was sometimes the first to give way
to angry passion, and to express in scathing words the bitterness
he felt. Yet his failings are those of an upright and honorable
character, and while they ought not to be extenuated or
denied, neither ought they to outweigh his great and unquestionable
merits. Appointed, as he believed, to a special work,
he bravely and honestly devoted his powers to the fulfillment
of that work, not even shrinking from his duty when it led
him to the cross.</p>

<p>His unhappy end has cast its shadow over his life. He has
been continually spoken of as "a man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief." There is no reason to suppose that in any special
sense he corresponded to the prophetic picture. Undoubtedly
he had his sorrows; undoubtedly he was acquainted with grief.
But unless there had been in his private life some tragedy of
which we are not informed, those sorrows were not of the bitterest,
nor was that grief of the deepest. There is no doubt in
his language a tinge of that sadness which all great natures who
are not in harmony with their age must needs experience. He
believed that he had great truths to tell, and he found his
countrymen unwilling to receive them. Here was one source of
unhappiness; and another he had in common with all who are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367"> 367</span>
deeply conscious of the miseries of human existence. But in no
special or transcendent sense can he be termed a man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief. So far as our evidence goes,
he was exempt from the most terrible calamities that befall
mankind. Free from all earthly ties but those of friendship
with his chosen companions, he was not exposed to many of
the anxieties and trials which afflict more ordinary men. Dying
young, he did not suffer (so far as we know) from any serious
illness, nor from the troubles, both physical and mental, that
scarcely ever fail to beset a longer life. Bereavement, the most
terrible or human ills, never afflicted him. Whether in his
youth he had suffered the pains of unrequited love at the
hands of some Galilean maiden we cannot tell. But there is
nothing in his language or his career that would lead us to see
in him an embittered or disappointed man.</p>

<p>Judging by the representation given in the Gospels, it does
not appear that his life was in any special measure sad or
gloomy. On the contrary, his circumstances were in the main
conducive to a fair share of happiness. Surrounded by admiring
friends of his own sex, and attended by sympathizing (perhaps
loving) women, he passed from place to place, drawing
crowds around him, speaking his mind freely, and receiving
no inconsiderable homage. Granting that he had enemies, he
was able until his prosecution to meet them on equal terms,
and was not prohibited (as he would have been in most Christian
countries until recent times) from proclaiming aloud his
unorthodox opinions. True, this liberty was not allowed to continue
for ever, but it was no small matter for him that it had
continued so long. True, he suffered a painful death; but far
less painful than many a humble martyr has undergone for his
sake; far less painful even than those torturing illnesses which
so often precede the hour of rest. Nor is it possible that his
death could reflect its agonies back upon his life. His life, on
the whole, seems to have been one, if not of abundant happiness,
yet of a fair and reasonable degree of cheerfulness and
of comfort. The notion that he had not where to lay his head
is of course utterly unfounded. Not only had he his own house
at Nazareth, but he had friends who at all times were happy to
receive him. If he himself ever drew this sad picture of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368"> 368</span>
desolation (which I doubt), he must have done it for a special
purpose, and without regard to the literal accuracy of his words.</p>

<p>While, then, I see no proof of the peculiar sorrow ascribed
to him on the strength of a prophecy, I freely admit that he
had the melancholy which belongs to a sympathetic heart. His
words of regret over Jerusalem are unsurpassed in their beauty.
At this closing period of his career we may indeed detect the
sadness of disappointment. And in the bitter cry that was
wrung from him at the end, "My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?" we look down for a moment into an abyss of
misery which it is painful to contemplate; physical suffering
and a shaken faith, the agonies of unaccomplished purposes,
and the still more fearful agony of desertion by the loving
Father in whom he had put his trust.</p>

<p>But Jesus, though he knew it not, had done his work. Nay,
he had done more than he himself intended. After-ages saw in
him—what he saw only in his God—an ideal to be worshiped
and a power to be addressed in prayer. We, who are free from
this exaggeration of reverence, may yet continue to pay him
the high and unquestioned honor which his unflinching devotion
to his duty, his gentle regard for the weak and suffering, his
uncorrupted purity of mind, and his self-sacrificing love so
abundantly deserve.</p>

<small>HOLY BOOKS, OR BIBLES.</small></h3></div>


<p>Vast, and even immeasurable, as the influence has been
which has been exercised on the course of human development
by the great men of whom we have spoken, it has been equaled,
if not surpassed, by the influence of the peculiar class of writings
which we have grouped together under the designation of
Holy Books. Of this, the last manifestation of the Religious
Idea, it will be necessary to speak in considerable detail; both
on account of its intrinsic importance, and because it is a branch
of the subject which has not hitherto received the attention it
deserves.</p>

<p>We have been far too much accustomed in Europe to treat
the Bible as a book standing altogether by itself; to be admired,
reverenced and loved, or, it may be, to be criticised, objected to
and rejected, not as one of a class, but as something altogether
peculiar and unparalleled in the literary history of the world.
And, undoubtedly, if we compare it with ordinary literature of
whatever description, whatever age, and whatever nation, this
opinion is just. Neither in the poetry, the history, or the philosophy
of any other nation do we find any work that at all resembles
it. Nevertheless it would be a very rash conclusion to
arrive at, that because in the whole field of Greek or Roman, Italian
or French, Teutonic or Celtic literature, there is nothing
that admits of being put in the same category with the Bible,
therefore the Bible cannot be placed in any category at all. It
is one of a numerous class; a class marked by certain distinct
characteristics; a class of which some specimen is held in
honor from the furthest East of Asia, to the extreme West of
America, or, in other words, throughout every portion of the
surface of the earth which is inhabited by any race with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370"> 370</span>
smallest pretense to civilization and to culture. Wherever
there is literature at all, there are Sacred Books. If in some
isolated cases it is not so, these cases are exceptions too trifling
in extent to invalidate the rule. Speaking generally we may say,
that every people which has risen above the conditions of savage
life; every nation which possesses an organized administration,
a settled domestic life, a religion with developed and complex
dogmas, possesses also its Sacred Books. If this truth has been
too generally forgotten; if the Bible has been too commonly
treated as something exceptional and peculiar which it was the
glory of Christianity to possess, this omission is probably in
great part due to the fact that the attention of scholars has
been too much confined to the literature, the religion, and the
general culture of the Greeks and Romans. From special circumstances
these nations had no Sacred writings among them.
Their religion was independent of any such authorities; and
our notions of pagan religion have been largely drawn from
the religions of Greece and Rome. But the Greeks and Romans
were only an insignificant fraction of the Aryan race;
and other far more numerous branches of that race had their
recognized and authoritative Scriptures, containing in some
portions those most ancient traditions of the original stock
which entered into the intellectual property of the Hellenic
family, in the form of mythological tales and current stories of
their gods. We must not therefore be led by the example of
classical antiquity to ignore the existence of these writings, or
to overlook their importance.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>We may classify the Sacred Books to which reference will be
made in this chapter as follows, proceeding (as in the case of
prophets) from East to West:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. <span class="smcap">The Thirteen King</span>, or Canon of the Confucians.</li>
<li>2. The <span class="smcap">Taò-tĕ-Kīng</span>, or Canon of the Taò-sè.</li>
<li>3. The <span class="smcap">Veda</span>, or Canon of the Hindus.</li>
<li>4. The <span class="smcap">Tripitaka</span>, or Canon of the Buddhists.</li>
<li>5. The <span class="smcap">Zend Avesta</span>, or Canon of the Parsees.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371"> 371</span></li>
<li>6. The <span class="smcap">Koran</span>, or Canon of the Moslems.</li>
<li>7. The <span class="smcap">Old Testament</span>, or Canon of the Jews.</li>
<li>8. The <span class="smcap">New Testament</span>, or Canon of the Christians.</li>
</ul>


<p>The works included in the above list,—which are more
numerous than might at first appear, owing to the vast collections
comprised under the titles "Vedas," and "Tripitaka,"—are
distinguished, as has been already stated, by certain common
characteristics. It would be an exaggeration to say that
all of these characteristics apply to each one of the writings
accepted by any portion of mankind as canonical. This cannot
be so, any more than the peculiar qualities which may happen
to distinguish any given race of men can ever belong in equal
measure to all its members. Hence there will necessarily be
some exceptions to our rules, but on the whole I believe we
may say with confidence that canonical or sacred books have
the following distinctive marks:—</p>

<p>A. There are certain external marks, the presence of which
is essential to constitute them sacred at all.</p>

<p>1. They must be accepted by the sectaries of the religion to
which they belong as being either inspired, or, if the nature of
the faith precludes this idea, as containing the highest wisdom
to which it is possible for man to attain, and indeed a much
higher wisdom than can be reached by ordinary men. Nor do
those who accept these books ever expect to attain it. They
regard the authors, or supposed authors, as enlightened to a
degree which is beyond the reach of their disciples, and receive
their words as utterances of an unquestionable authority. But
wherever a divine being is acknowledged, these books are
regarded as emanating from him. Either they have fallen direct
from heaven and been merely "seen" by their human editors,
as was the case with the Vedic hymns; or their contents have
been communicated in colloquies to holy men by the Deity
himself, as happened with the Avesta; or an angel has revealed
them to the prophet while in a fit or a state of ecstacy, as
Mahomet was made acquainted with the Suras of the Koran; or
lastly, as is held to have been the case with the Jewish and
Christian Scriptures, the mind of the writer has been at least so
guided and informed by the Spirit of God, that in the words
traced by his pen it was impossible he should err.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372"> 372</span></p>

<p>Such a conviction is expressly stated in the Second Epistle
to Timothy, where it is said that "all Scripture is given by inspiration
of God." And a claim to even more than inspiration
is put forward in the Apocalypse, whose author first calls his
work "the Revelation of Jesus Christ," which he says God sent
to him by an angel deputed for the purpose, and then proceeds
to describe voices heard, and visions perceived; thus resting his
prophetic knowledge not on supernatural information communicated
to the mind, but on the direct testimony of his senses.</p>

<p>2. With this theory of inspiration, or of a more than human
knowledge and wisdom, is closely connected an idea of <i>merit</i> to
be obtained by reading such books, or hearing them read.
With tedious iteration is this notion asserted in the later works
of the Buddhist Canon. These indeed represent the degeneracy
of the idea. One of them is so filled with the panegyrics pronounced
upon itself by the Buddha or his hearers, and with the
recital of the advantages to be obtained by him who reads it,
that the student searches in vain under this mass of laudations
for the substance of the book itself (H. B. I., p. 536). A Sûtra
translated by Schlagintweit from the Thibetan, and bearing the
marks (according to its translator) of having been written at a
period of "mystic modification of Buddhism," promises that,
at a future period of intense and general distress this Sûtra
"will be an ablution for every kind of sin which has been committed
in the meantime: all animated beings shall read it, and
on account of it all sins shall be wiped away" (B. T., p. 139).
In another Sûtra, termed the Karanda vyuha, a great saint is
introduced as exhorting his hearers to study this treatise, the
efficaciousness of which he highly exalts (H. B. I., p. 222).
Another speaker recites in several stanzas the advantages which
will accrue to him who either reads the Karanda vyuha or hears
it read (Ibid., p. 226). Such was the force of the idea that the
mere mechanical reading or copying of the sacred texts was in
itself meritorious, that, by a still further separation of the outward
action from its rational signification, the purely unintelligent
process of turning a cylinder on which sentences of
Scripture were printed came to be regarded as equally efficacious.
An author who has given an interesting account of these
cylinders observes that, as few men in Thibet knew how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373"> 373</span>
read, and those who did had not time to exercise their powers,
"the Lamas cast about for an expedient to enable the ignorant
and the much-occupied man also to obtain the spiritual advantages"
(namely, purification from sin and exemption from metempsychosis)
"attached to an observance of the practice mentioned;
they taught that the mere turning of a rolled manuscript
might be considered an efficacious substitute for reading
it." So completely does the one process take the place of the
other that "each revolution of the cylinder is considered to be
equal to the reading of as many sacred sentences or treatises as
are enclosed in it, provided that the turning of the cylinder is
done slowly and from right to left;" the slowness being a sign
of a devout mind, and the direction of turning being a curious
remnant of the original practice of reading, in which, as the
letters run from left to right, the eye must move over them in
that direction (B. T., pp. 230, 231). Similar sentiments, though
not pushed to the same extravagance, prevail among the Hindus.
One of the Brâhmanas, or treatises appended to the metrical
portion of the Vedas, lays down the principle that "of all
the modes of exertion, which are known between heaven and
earth, study of the Veda occupies the highest rank (in the case
of him) who, knowing this, studies it" (O. S. T., vol. iii. p. 22).
Manu, one of the highest of Indian authorities, observes that
"a Brahman who should destroy these three worlds, and eat
food received from any quarter whatever, would incur no guilt
if he retained in his memory the Rig Veda. Repeating thrice
with intent mind the Sanhitâ of the Rik, or the Yajush, or the
Sâman, with the Upanishads, he is freed from all his sins.
Just as a clod thrown into a great lake is dissolved when it
touches the water, so does all sin sink in the triple Veda"
(Ibid., vol. iii. p. 25). Reading the Holy Scriptures is with the
Parsees a positive duty. And these works, read in the proper
spirit, are thought to exert upon earth an influence somewhat
similar to that of the primeval Word at the origin of created
beings (Z. A. Q., p. 595). It is needless to speak of the importance
attached among Jews and Christians to the reading and
re-reading of their Bibles, or of the spiritual benefits supposed
to result therefrom. It is worth remarking, however, that this
constant perusal of Holy Writ is altogether a different operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374"> 374</span>
from that of studying it for the sake of knowing its contents.
People read continually what they are already perfectly familiar
with, and they neither gain, nor expect to gain, any fresh information
from the performance. And this is a species of reading
to which among Christian nations the Bible alone is subjected.</p>

<p>The genesis of this notion is not difficult to follow. Once let
a given work be accepted as containing information on religious
questions which man's unaided faculties could not have attained,
and it is evident that there is no better way of qualifying
himself for the performance of his obligations towards heaven
than by studying that work. Its perusal and re-perusal will
increase his knowledge of divine things, and render him more
and more fit, the oftener he repeats it, to put that knowledge
into practice. But if it is thus advantageous to the devout man
to be familiar with the sacred writings of his faith, it is plain
that the attention he gives to them must be in the highest degree
agreeable to the divinity from whom they emanate. For,
to put it on the lowest ground, it is a sign of respect. It renders
it evident that he is not indifferent to the communication
which his God has been pleased to make. It evinces a pious
and reverential disposition. Hence not only is the reader benefited
by such a study, but the Deity is pleased by it. Or if the
books are not conceived as inspired by any deity, yet a careful
attention to them shows a desire for wisdom, and a humble
regard for the instructions of more highly-gifted men who in
these religions stand in the place of gods. Thus the action of
reading these works, and becoming thoroughly familiar with
their contents, is for natural reasons regarded as meritorious.
But this is not all. An act which at first is meritorious as a
means, tends inevitably to become meritorious as an end.
Moreover, actions frequently repeated for some definite reason
come to be repeated when that reason is absent. Thus, the
reading of Sacred Books, originally a profitable exercise to the
mind of the reader, is soon undertaken for its own sake, whether
the mind of the reader be concerned in it or not. And the action,
having become habitual, is stereotyped as a religious custom,
and therefore a religious obligation. The words of the holy
books are read aloud to a congregation, without effort or intelligence
on their part, perhaps in a tongue which they do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375"> 375</span>
comprehend. Even if the vernacular be employed, there is not
the pretence of an effort to penetrate the sense of difficult passages.
Holy Writ has become a charm, to be mechanically read
and as mechanically heard, and the notion of merit—arising in
the first instance from the high importance of understanding
its meaning with a view to practicing its precepts—now attaches
to the mere repetition of the consecrated words.</p>

<p>3. The exact converse of this unintelligent reverence for the
sacred writings is the excessive and over-subtle exercise of intelligence
upon them. It is the common fate of such works to
be made the subject of the most minute, most careful, and
most constant scrutiny to which any of the productions of the
human mind can be subjected. The pious and the learned
alike submit them to an unceasing study. No phrase, no word,
no letter, passes unobserved. The result of this devout investigation
naturally is, that much which in reality belongs to the
mind of the reader is attributed to that of the writer. Approached
with the fixed prepossession that they contain vast
stores of superhuman wisdom, that which is so eagerly sought
from them is certain to be found. Hence the natural and simple
meaning of the words is set aside, or is relegated to a secondary
place. All sorts of forced interpretations are put upon
them with a view of compelling them to harmonize with that
which it is supposed they ought to mean. Statements, doctrines,
and allusions are discovered in them which not only have
no existence in their pages, but which are absolutely foreign to
the epoch at which they were written. This process of false
interpretation is greatly favored by distance of time. When an
ancient book is approached by those who know but little of the
external circumstances, or of the intellectual and spiritual atmosphere,
of the age in which it was composed, much that was
simple and plain enough to the contemporaries of the writer
will be dubious and obscure to them. And when they are determined
to find in the venerable classic nothing but perfect
truth, the result of such conditions is an inevitable confusion.
Their own actual notions of truth must at all hazards be discovered
in the sacred pages. The assumption cannot be surrendered;
all that does not agree with it must therefore be suitably
explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376"> 376</span></p>

<p>Are proceedings or actions which shock the improved morality
of a later age spoken of with approbation in the canonical
books? Some evasion must be discovered which will reconcile
ethics with belief. Are doctrines which the religion of a later
age rejects plainly enunciated, or statements of facts, which
later investigation has shown to be impossible, unequivocally
made? The inconvenient passages must be shown to bear another
construction. Are there portions whose character appears
too trivial or too mundane to be consistent with the dignity of
works given for the instruction of mankind? These portions
must be shown to possess a mystical significance; a spirit hidden
beneath the letter; profound instruction veiled under ordinary
phrases. Are the dogmas cherished as of supreme importance
by subsequent generations unhappily not to be found
in the text of Revelation? These dogmas must be read out of
them by putting a strain upon words which apparently refer to
some other subject. Perhaps, if they are not contained in
them <i>totidem verbis</i>, they may be <i>totidem syllabis</i>: or if not
even <i>totidem syllabis</i>, at least <i>totidem literis</i>. And the absence
of a letter (like the k in shoulder-knots) can always be got
over somehow. Lastly, are there palpable contradictions? At
whatever cost they must be explained away, for Holy Writ,
being inspired, can never contradict itself.</p>

<p>Let us consider a few of the most striking examples of these
methods of treatment. China, usually so matter of fact, has
manifested in this field a subtlety of interpretation not altogether
unworthy of the more mystical India. The Ch'un
Ts'ëw, one of the books of the Chinese Canon, is a historical
compilation attributed to Confucius himself, and is therefore of
more than ordinary authority even for a Sacred Book. Concerning
one of the years of which it contains a record, the following
statements are made:—</p>

<p>"In the ninth month, on Kang-seuk, the first day of the
moon, the sun was eclipsed.</p>

<p>"In winter, in the tenth month, on Kang-shin, the first day
of the moon, the sun was eclipsed" (C. C., vol. v. p. 489.—Ch'un
Ts'ëw, b. 9, ch. xxi. p. 5, 6).</p>

<p>Two eclipses in such close proximity were of course an impossibility.
Chinese scholars were fully aware of this, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377"> 377</span>
knew, moreover, that the second eclipse mentioned did not
take place. A similar mistake occurred in another chapter, so
that there were two unquestionable blunders to be got over. No
wonder then that "the critics," as Dr. Legge says, "have vexed
themselves with the question in vain." But one of them proposes
an explanation. "In this year," he remarks, "and in the
twenty-fourth year, we have the record of eclipses in successive
months. According to modern chronologists such a thing could
not be; but <i>perhaps it did occur in ancient times</i>!" (Ibid., vol. v.
p. 491). Dr. Legge has italicized the concluding words, and put
an exclamation after them, as if they embodied a surprising
absurdity. But his experience of Biblical criticism must have
presented him with abundant instances of similar interpretations
of the glaring contradictions to modern science found in
Scripture. Is it more ridiculous to suppose that the two eclipses
might have occurred in two months than to believe that the
sun stood still, in other words, that the revolution of the earth
on its axis ceased for a space of time? or that an ass could be
endowed with human speech? or that a man, instead of dying,
could rise from earth to heaven? And if these and similar
strange occurrences be explained as miracles, then such miracles
"did occur in ancient times," and do not now. Or if it be
attempted, as it is by interpreters of the rationalistic school to
get over the difficulty by supposing a natural event as the foundation
of the story—as one writer suggests that the descent of
the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was a strong blast of wind—then
European critics, like those of China, "vex themselves in vain."</p>

<p>No country, however, has done more than India, possibly
none has done so much, in the peculiar exercise of ingenuity by
which all sorts of senses are deduced from sacred texts. The
Veda formed in that highly religious land the common basis on
which each variety of philosophy was founded, and by which
each was thought to be justified. Dr. Muir has collected a
number of facts in proof of the diverse interpretations that
found defenders among the champions of the several schools. In
these facts, according to him, "we find another illustration (1)
of the tendency common to all dogmatic theologians to interpret
in strict conformity to their own opinions the unsystematic and
not always consistent texts of an earlier age which have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378"> 378</span>
handed down by tradition as sacred and infallible, and to represent
them as containing, or as necessarily implying, fixed and
consistent systems of doctrine; as well as (2) of the diversity of
view which so generally prevails in regard to the sense of such
texts among writers of different schools, who adduce them with
equal positiveness of assertion as establishing tenets and principles
which are mutually contradictory or inconsistent" (O. S.
T., vol. iii. p. xx).</p>

<p>Exactly the same methods were applied to the sacred books
of Buddhism. "It is in general," says Burnouf, "the same
texts that serve as a foundation for all doctrines; only the explanation
of these texts marks the naturalistic, theistic, moral
or intellectual tendency" (H. B. I., p. 444). To meet the case
of contradictions occurring in the Buddhistic Sûtras a theory of
a double meaning has been invented. The various schools that
had arisen in the course of time did not venture to reject the
Sûtras that failed to harmonize with their own opinions, as not
having emanated from Buddha, but maintained he had not expressed
them in the form of absolute truth. He had often, they
thought, adapted himself to the conceptions of his hearers, and
uttered what was directly contradictory to his veritable ideas.
Hence his words must be taken in two senses; the palpable and
the hidden sense (Wassiljew, pp. 105, 329). As it has been with
the Chinese Classics, with the Veda, and with the Tripitaka, so
it has been with the Zend Avesta. Speaking of the progress of
scholarship in deciphering the sense of that ancient work, Professor
Max Müller justly observes that "greater violence is done
by successive interpreters to sacred writings than to any other
relics of ancient literature. Ideas grow and change, yet each
generation tries to find its own ideas reflected in the sacred
pages of their early prophets, and in addition to the ordinary
influences which blur and obscure the sharp features of old
words, artificial influences are here at work distorting the natural
expression of words which have been invested with a sacred
authority. Passages in the Veda or Zend Avesta which do not
bear on religious or philosophical doctrines, are generally explained
simply and naturally, even by the latest of native commentators.
But as soon as any word or sentence can be so
turned as to support a doctrine, however modern, or a precept,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379"> 379</span>
however irrational, the simplest phrases are tortured and mangled
till at last they are made to yield their assent to ideas the
most foreign to the minds of the authors of the Veda and Zend
Avesta" (Chips, vol. i. p. 134).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that almost identical expressions are employed
by a Roman Catholic writer in reference to the efforts
that have been made by theologians to discover the doctrine of
the Trinity in the pages of the Hebrew Bible. I am glad to be
able to quote an authority so unexceptionable as that of M.
Didron for the proposition, that the poverty of the Old Testament
in texts relating to the Trinity has caused the commentators
to torture the sense of the words and the signification of
facts. He adds the interesting information that artists, pushed
on by the commentators, have represented the signs of the
Trinity in scenes which did not admit of them. Thus, commentators
and artists have united to find a revelation of the three
persons of the Godhead in the three angels whom Abraham
met in the plain of Mamre; in the three companions of Daniel
who were thrown into the fiery furnace, and in other passages
of equal relevance. No wonder, when such are the texts relied
upon to prove the presence of this cardinal dogma, that M.
Didron should observe that the Old Testament contains very
few texts that are clear and precise upon the subject, and that
in this portion of the Sacred Books we do not see a sufficient
number of real and unquestionable manifestations of the Holy
Trinity (Ic. Ch., pp. 514-517).</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the most conspicuous instance of the power
of preconceptions in deciding the sense of Holy Writ is the
traditional interpretation of the Song of Solomon. In this little
book, which is altogether secular in its subject and its nature,
the love of a young damsel to her swain is described in peculiarly
plain and sensuous language. But precisely because it
was so plain was it necessary to find allegorical allusions under
its rather glowing phrases. Hence such expressions as "let
him kiss me with a kiss of his mouth; thy caresses are softer
than wine," are held to refer to "the Church's love unto
Christ," and an enthusiastic encomium passed by the Shulamite
upon the physical perfections of her lover is called "a description
of Christ by his graces." So, when another speaker, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380"> 380</span>
this case a man, flatters a woman by enumerating the beauties
of her form, the feet, the joints of her thighs, the navel, the
belly, the two breasts so passionately praised by her admirer,
are thought in some mystic way to signify the graces of the
Church. A passage referring to a young girl not yet fully developed
is made out to be a foreshadowing of "the calling of the
Gentiles," and the natural and simple appeal to a lover to
make haste to come is "the Church praying for Christ's coming."</p>

<p>Equal, or nearly equal, absurdities are found in the Chinese
interpretations of certain Odes contained in their classics.
These Odes are, like the Song of Songs, mere expressions of human
love. But the critics find in them profound historical
allusions; history being the staple of the Chinese sacred books,
as theology is of the Hebrew ones. Now it happened in China,
as it has happened in Europe, that there was a traditional
meaning attached to this portion of the sacred books; and the
traditional meaning was embodied in a Preface which was generally
supposed to have descended from very ancient times,
which came to be incorporated with the Odes, and thus appeared
to rest on the same authority as the text itself. But a
Chinese scholar, named Choo He, who examined the preface in
a freer spirit than was usual among the commentators, formed
a very different opinion as to its age and its authority. He
believed it to be of much more recent date that was commonly
supposed, and by no means to form an integral portion of the
Odes. The prevailing theory was that the Preface had existed
as a separate document in the time of a scholar named Maou,
"and that he broke it up, prefixing to each Ode the portion belonging
to it. The natural conclusion," observes Choo He, "is that
the Preface had come down from a remote period, and Hwang"
(a scholar who, in one account, is said to have written the Preface)
"merely added to it and rounded it off. In accordance
with this, scholars generally hold that the first sentences in the
introductory notices formed the original Preface which Maou
distributed, and that the following portions were subsequently
added. This view may appear reasonable, but when we examine
those first sentences themselves we find some of them
which do not agree with the obvious meaning of the Odes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381"> 381</span>
which they are prefixed, and give merely the rash and baseless
expositions of the writers." Choo He adds, that after the prefatory
notices were published as a portion of the text, "they
appeared as if they were the production of the poets themselves
and the Odes seemed to be made from them as so many
themes. Scholars handed down a faith in them from one to
another, and no one ventured to express a doubt of their
authority. The text was twisted and chiseled to bring it into
accordance with them, and nobody would undertake to say
plainly that they were the work of the scholars of the Han
dynasty" (C. C., vol. iv. Proleg., p. 33).</p>

<p>Ample confirmation of the justice of Choo He's opinion will
be found on turning to the Odes and comparing them with the
notices in the Preface, which bear a family likeness to the
headings of the chapters in the Song of Songs. Here, for example,
is an Ode:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"If you, Sir, think kindly of me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will hold up my lower garments, and cross the Tsin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you do not think of me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is there no other person [to do so?]</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You foolish, foolish fellow!"<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The second stanza is identical, with this exception, that the
name of the river is changed. Now this young lady's coquettish
appeal to her lover is said in the Preface to be an expression
"of the desire of the people of Ch'ing to have the condition
of the State rectified" (C. C., vol. iv. Proleg., p. 51).
Another Ode runs thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">1. "The sun is in the east,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that lovely girl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is in my chamber.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is in my chamber;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She treads in my footsteps, and comes to me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">2. "The moon is in the east,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that lovely girl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is inside my door.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382"> 382</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is inside my door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She treads in my footsteps, and hastens away."<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This simple poem is supposed by the Preface to be "directed
against the decay [of the times]." Observe the theory that
anything appearing in a sacred book must have a moral purpose.
"The relation of ruler and minister was neglected. Men
and women sought each other in lewd fashion; and there was
no ability to alter the customs by the rules of propriety" (C.
C., vol. iv. Proleg., p. 52). A commentator, studious to discover
the hidden moral, urges that the incongruous fact of the young
woman's coming at sunrise and going at moonrise "should satisfy
us that, under the figuration of these lovers, is intended a
representation of Ts'e, with bright or with gloomy relations
between its ruler and officers" (C. C., vol. iv. p. 153, note). In
another Ode a lady laments her husband's absence, pathetically
saying that while she does not see him, her heart cannot forget
its grief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"How is it, how is it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he forgets me so very much?"</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">is the burden of every stanza. This piece, according to the
Preface, was directed against a duke, "who slighted the men of
worth whom his father had collected around him, leaving the
State without those who were its ornament and strength" (C.
C., vol. iv. p. 200, and the note.—She King, pt. i. b. 11, ode 7).</p>

<p>With such methods as these there is no marvel which may
not be accomplished. And when, by the lapse of many centuries,
the very language of the sacred records has been forgotten—as
the Sanscrit of the Vedas was forgotten by the Hindus,
the Zend by the Parsees, and the Hebrew by the Jews—the
process of perversion is still further favored. The original works
are then accessible but to a few; and when these few undertake
to explain them in the ordinary tongue, they will do so with a
gloss suggested by their own imperfect comprehension of the
thoughts and language of the past.</p>

<p>These, then, may be accepted as the external marks of Sacred
Books: 1. The unusual veneration accorded to them by the ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383"> 383</span>herents
of each religion, on the ground that they contain truths
beyond the reach of human intelligence when not specially
enlightened; or in other words, the theory of their <i>inspiration</i>.
2. The notion of <i>religious merit</i> attached to reading them. 3.
The application to them of <i>forced interpretation</i>, in order to
bring them into accordance with the assumptions made regarding
them.</p>

<p>B. Passing now to the internal marks by which writings of
this class are distinguished, we shall find several which, taken
together, constitute them altogether a peculiar branch of literature.</p>

<p>1. Their subjects are generally confined within a certain
definite range, but in the limits of that range there is a considerable
portion which has the peculiarity that their investigation
transcends the unaided powers of the human intellect. Almost
the whole of the vast field of theological dogma comes under
this head. The sublimer subjects usually dealt with, and not
only dealt with, but emphatically dwelt upon, in the Sacred
Books are, the nature of the Deity and his mode of action
towards mankind; the creation of the world and its various
constituent parts, including man himself; the motives of the
Deity in these exercises of his power; the dogmas to be believed
in reference to the Deity himself and in reference to other
superhuman powers or agencies, whether good or bad; and the
condition of the soul after death with the rewards and the punishments
of vicious conduct. Coming down to matters of a
less purely celestial character, but still beyond the reach of the
uninspired faculties of ordinary minds, they treat of the primitive
condition of mankind when first placed upon the earth; of
his earliest history; of the rites by which the divine being is
to be worshiped; of the sacrifices which are to be offered to
him; of the ceremonies by which his favor is to be won. Here
we move in a region which is at least intelligible and free from
mysteries, though it is plain that we could not arrive at any
certain conclusions on such things as these without divine assistance
and superhuman illumination.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Sacred Books of all nations profess to give information
on a subject the nature of which is altogether mundane,
and with regard to which truth is accessible to all, inspired or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384"> 384</span>
uninspired;—the rules of moral conduct. These are, I believe,
the main subjects which will be found treated of in the various
books that lay claim to the title of Sacred. These subjects may
be briefly classified as, 1. Metaphysical speculations as to the
nature of the Deity. 2. Doctrines as to the past or future existence
of the soul. 3. Accounts of the creation. 4. Lives of
prophets or collections of their sayings. 5. Theories as to the
origin of evil. 6. Prescriptions as to ritual. 7. Ethics. That
this does not pretend to be an exhaustive classification, I need
hardly say; other topics are treated in some of them to which
no allusion is made, and all of these topics themselves are not
treated at all. But they are those with which the Sacred Books
are principally concerned; and more than this, they are those
in the treatment of which these books are especially peculiar.
One important feature both of the Chinese and the Jewish
Canon is passed over, namely, their historical records. If these
records were not exceptional appearances in sacred works, or if,
though exceptional, they presented some essential singularity
marking them off from all ordinary history, they should be
included in the list of subjects. But as the Chinese Shoo
King are perfectly commonplace annals of matters of fact; and
as the Books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles are not otherwise
distinguished from secular history than by their theological
theories—in respect of which they are included under the
previous heads—I see no reason to include history among the
matters generally treated in Sacred Books. It is right, however,
to note in passing that in these two instances it is found
in them.</p>

<p>2. Since, however, it will be obvious to all that these great
topics are discussed in many other works which have no pretension
to be thought sacred, we must seek for some further and
more definite criterion by which to separate them from general
literature. And we shall find it in the <i>manner</i> in which the
above-named subjects are treated. The great distinction between
sacred and non-sacred writings in their manner of dealing with
these great questions is the tone of authority, and if the expression
may be used, of finality, assumed by the former. There
is no appeal beyond them to a higher authority than their own.
Having God as their author and inspirer, or being the product<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385"> 385</span>
of the supreme elevation of reason, they take for granted that
human beings will not question or cavil at their statements.
While other writers, when seeking to enforce the doctrines of
any positive religion, invariably rest their contentions, implicitly
or explicitly, on some superior authority, referring their
readers or hearers either to the Vedas, the Koran, the Bible,
the Church, or some other recognized standard of belief and
would think it in the last degree presumptuous to claim assent
except to what can be found in or deduced from that standard;
while those teachers who are not the exponents of any positive,
revealed religion, endeavor to prove their conclusions from the
common intuitions or the common reasoning faculties of mankind;
the writers of these books do neither. They seem to
speak with a full confidence that their words need no confirmation
either from authority or from reason. If they tell us the
story of the creation of the world, they do not think it needful
to inform us from what sources the narrative is derived. If
they reveal the character of God, it is without explaining the
means by which their insight has been obtained. If they lay
down the rules of religious or moral conduct, it is not done
with the modesty of fallible teachers, but with the voice of
unqualified command emanating from the plentitude of power.
Of their decisions there can be no discussion; from their sentences
there is no appeal.</p>

<p>3. It corresponds with this character that Sacred Books
should very generally be anonymous; or more strictly speaking,
impersonal; that is, that they should not be put forward in
the name of an individual, and that no individual should take
credit for their authorship. Understanding the expression in
this somewhat wider sense, we may say that anonymity is a
general characteristic of this class of writings. Their authors
do not desire to invite attention to their own personality, or to
claim assent on the ground of respect or consideration towards
themselves. On the contrary, they withdraw entirely from observation;
they appear to be thoroughly engrossed in the greatness
of the subject; and to write not from any deliberate
design or with any artistic plan, but simply from the fullness
of the inspiration by which they are controlled. Hence not only
are the names of the authors in most cases completely lost to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386"> 386</span>
us, but they have left us not a hint or an indication by which
we could discover what manner of men they were. Even where
the name of a writer has been preserved to us, it is often
rather by some accident altogether independent of the book,
and which in no way alters its anonymous character. We happen
to know, on what seems to be good authority, that Laò-tsé
composed the Taò-tĕ-Kīng, but assuredly there is not a syllable
in the work itself which indicates its author. We happen to
know beyond a doubt that Mahomet composed the Koran; but
the theory of the book is that it had no human author at all,
and it was put forth, not as the prophet's composition, but as
the literal reproduction of revelations made to him from
heaven. The most noteworthy exceptions are the prophets of
the Old Testament and the Pauline, Petrine and Johannine
Epistles of the New. But of the prophets, though their names
are indeed given, the great majority are little more than a mere
name to us; while large portions of the prophecies, attributed
in the Jewish Canon to some celebrated prophet, are in reality
the work of unknown writers. This is notoriously the case with
the whole of the latter part of our Isaiah; it is the case with parts
of Jeremiah; it is the case with Malachi (whose real name is
not preserved); it is the case with Daniel.</p>

<p>The Pauline Epistles offer indeed a marked exception to the
rule; and some of them are of doubtful authenticity. The Epistles
of Peter, of John, of James and Jude, even if their authorship
be correctly assigned, are of too limited extent to constitute
an exception of any importance. The rest of the Christian
Bible follows the rule. Like the Vedic hymns, like the Sûtras
of Buddhism, like the records of the life and doctrines of Khung-tsé,
like the Avesta, all the larger books of the Bible—except
the prophets—are anonymous. The whole of the historical portion
of the Old Testament, the four Gospels, the Acts of the
Apostles, the Epistle to the Hebrews, are—whatever names tradition
may have associated with them—strictly the production
of unknown authors. This characteristic is one of very high
importance, because it indicates—along with another which I
am about to mention—the spirit in which these works were
written. They were written as it were unconsciously and undesignedly;
not of course without a knowledge on the writer's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387"> 387</span>
part of what he was about, but without that conscious and distinct
intention of composing a literary work with which ordinary
men sit down to write a book. Flowing from the depths of religious
feeling, they were the reflection of the age that brought
them forth. Generations past and present, nations, communities,
brotherhoods of believers, spoke in them and through them.
They were not only the work of him who first uttered them or
wrote them; others worked with him, thought with him, spoke
with him; they were not merely the voice of an individual, but
the voice of an epoch and of a people. Hence the utter absence
of any apparent and palpable authorship, the disappearance of
the individual in the grandeur of the subject. This phenomenon
is not indeed quite peculiar to Sacred Books. It belongs
also to those great national epics which likewise express the
feelings of whole races and communities of men; to the Mahâbhârata,
to the Râmâyana, to the Iliad and the Odyssey, to the
Volsungen and Nibelungen Sagas, to the Eddas, to the legends
of King Arthur and his knights. These poems, or these poetical
tales, are anonymous, and they occupy in the veneration of
the people a rank which is second only to that of books actually
sacred. In some other respects they bear a resemblance to
Sacred Books, but these books differ from them in one important
particular, which of itself suffices to place them in a different
category. What that particular is must now be explained.</p>

<p>4. If I were to describe it by a single word, I should call it
their <i>formlessness</i>. The term is an awkward one, but I know of
no other which so exactly describes this most peculiar feature
of Sacred Books. Like the earth in its chaotic condition before
creation, they are "without form." That artistic finish, that
construction, combination of parts into a well-defined edifice,
that arrangement of the whole work upon an apparent plan, subservient
to a distinct object, which marks every other class of
the productions of the human mind, is entirely wanting to
them. They read not unfrequently as if they had been carelessly
jotted down without the smallest regard to order, or the
least attention to the effect to be produced on the mind of the
reader. Sometimes they may even be said to have neither beginning,
middle, nor end. We might open them anywhere and
close them anywhere without material difference. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388"> 388</span>
there is a distinct progress in the narrative, but it is nevertheless
wholly without methodical combination of the separate
parts into a well-ordered whole. Herein they differ also from
those poetical Epics which we have found agreeing with them
in being virtually anonymous. Nothing can exceed the grace,
the finish, the perfection of style, of those immortal poems
which are known as Homeric. The northern Epics are indeed
simpler, ruder, far more destitute of literary merit. The first
part, for instance, of the Edda Saemundar (which perhaps
ought not to be called an Epic at all) is to the last degree
uncouth and barbarous. But then the subject-matter of this
portion of the Edda is such as belongs properly to Sacred
Books, and had it ever been actually current among the Scandinavians
as a canonical work—of which we have no evidence—it
would be entitled to a place among them. When we come
to the second or heroic portion of this Edda, the case is different.
The mode of treatment is still rude and unattractive, but
if, unrepelled by the outward form, we study the longest of the
narratives which this division contains—the Saga of the Volsungs—we
shall discover in it a tale, which for the exquisite
pathos of its sentiments, for the deep and tragic interest which
centres round the principal characters, for the vivid delineation
by a few brief touches of the intensest suffering, is scarcely
surpassed even by the far more finished productions of Hellenic
genius. No doubt the foundation of the story is mythological,
and this throws over many of its incidents a grotesqueness
which goes far in modern eyes to mar the effect. But the mythological
incidents of the Iliad and the Odyssey are grotesque
also, and it requires all the genius of the poet to render them
tolerable. Apart from this groundwork, the Volsunga-Saga
treats its personages as human, and claims from its readers a
purely human interest in their various adventures. It relates
these adventures in a connected form, it depicts the feelings of
the several actors with all the sympathy of the dramatist, and
draws no moral, teaches no lesson. In the whole range of
sacred literature I recollect nothing like this. Stories are doubtless
told in it, but we are made to feel that they are subservient
to an ulterior purpose. In the Old Testament and in the New,
they serve to enforce the theological doctrines of the writers; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389"> 389</span>
the works of the Buddhists they generally impress on the
hearers some useful lesson as to the reward of merit, and the
punishment of demerit, in a future existence. Of the genuine
and simple relation of a rather elaborate romance, terminating
in itself, there is probably no instance. Such stories as are
related are moral tales, and not romances; and they are generally
too short to absorb, in any considerable degree, the interest
of the reader.</p>

<p>While this is the difference between secular and Sacred
Books in respect of their narrative portions, the sacred are as
a whole even more decidedly below the secular in all that belongs
to style and composition. The dullest historian generally
contrives to render his chronicle more lucid, and therefore more
readable, than the authors of canonical books. In these last
there is the most absolute disregard of artistic or literary excellence.
Hence they are, with scarcely an exception, very tedious
reading. M. Renan observes of the Koran that its continuous
perusal is almost intolerable. Burnouf hesitates to inflict upon
his readers the tedium he himself has suffered from the study
of certain Tantras. The inconceivable tediousness of the Buddhistic
Sûtras—excepting the earlier and simpler ones—is well
known to those who have read or attempted to read such works,
as, for instance, the Saddharma Pundarika. The Chinese Classics
are less repulsive, but few readers would care to study them
for long together. The Vedic hymns, though full of mythological
interest, are yet difficult and unpleasant reading, both from
their monotony and the looseness of the connection between
each verse and sentence. The Brâhmanas are barely readable.
The Avesta is far from attractive. The Bible, though vastly
superior in this respect to all the rest of its class, is yet not
easy to read for any length of time without fatigue. Doubtless,
if taken as a special study, with a view to something which we
desire to ascertain from it, we may without difficulty read large
portions at a time; yet we see that Christians, who read it for
edification, invariably choose in their public assemblies to confine
themselves to very moderate sections of it indeed, while
they will listen to sermons of many times the length. There
can be little doubt that a similar practice is pursued in private
devotion. Single chapters, or at most a few chapters, are se<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390"> 390</span>lected;
these are perused, and perhaps made the object of
meditation; but even the most fervent admirers of the Bible
would probably find it difficult to read through its longer books
without pausing. They do not, so to speak, "carry us on." It
was essential to dwell on this tediousness of Sacred Books, because
it forms one of their most marked characteristics. Nor
does it arise, as is often the case, from indifference or aversion
on the part of the reader. Other books repel us because we
have no interest in the subjects with which they deal. In these,
the keenest interest in the subjects with which they deal will
not suffice to render their presentation tolerable.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section I.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Thirteen King.</span><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h4>

<p>Sacred Books in general are in China termed <i>King</i>. But as
the Chinese Buddhists have their own sacred literature, and as
Taouists are in possession of a sacred work of their founder,
Laò-tsé, I call the Books of the State religion, that is, of the
followers of Confucius, <i>the</i> King <i>par excellence</i>. For Confucianism
is the official creed of the Government of China, and the
Confucian Canon forms the subject of the Civil Service examinations
which qualify for office. According to a competent
authority, "a complete knowledge of the whole of them, as
well as of the standard notes and criticisms by which they are
elucidated, is an indispensable condition towards the attainment
of the higher grades of literary and official rank" (Chinese,
vol. ii. p. 48).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391"> 391</span></p>

<p>The writings now recognized as especially sacred in China
are "the five King," and "the four Shoo."<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> <i>King</i> is a term of
which the proper signification is "the warp, the chain of a web:
thence that which progresses equally, that which constitutes a
fundamental law, the normal. Applied to books, it indicates
those that are regarded as canonical; as an absolute standard,
either in general or with reference to some definite object" (T.
T. K., p. lxviii). In the words of another Sinologue, it is "the
Rule, the Law, a book of canonical authority, a classical book"
(L. T., p. ix). The word seems therefore on the whole to correspond
most nearly to what we mean by a "canonical book."
<i>Shoo</i> means "Writings or Books." The four Shoo, of which I
shall speak first, are these:—A 1. The Lun Yu, or Digested
Conversations (of Confucius). A 2. The Ta Hëo, or Great Learning.
A 3. The Chung Yung, or Doctrine of the Mean. A 4.
The Works of Mang-tsze, or Mencius. The five King are
these:—B 1. The Yih, or Book of Changes (Noticed in
Pauthier, p. 137). B 2. The Shoo, or Book of History. B 3.
The She, or Book of Poetry. B 4. The Le Ke, or Record of
Rites. B 5. The Ch'un Ts'ëw, or Spring and Autumn, a chronicle
of events from <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 721-<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 480. The oldest enumeration
specified only the five King, to which the Yoke, or Record of
Music (now in the Le Ke), was sometimes added, making six.
There was also a division into nine King; and in the compilation
made by order of Táe-Tsung (who reigned in the 7th century
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>) there are specified thirteen King, which consist of:<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>—1-7.
The five King, including three editions of the Ch'un
Ts'ëw. 8. The Lun Yu (A 1). 9. Mang-tsze (A 4). 10. The Chow
Le, or Ritual of Chow. 11. The E Le, or Ceremonial Usages.
12. The Urh Ya, a sort of ancient dictionary. 13. The Heaou
King, or Classic of Filial Piety. The apparent omission of the
Ta Hëo (A 2) and the Chung Yung (A 3) is accounted for by the
fact that both are included in the Le Ke (B 4). The only works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392"> 392</span>
which it is at present in my power to speak of in detail are
those classified as A 1 to A 4, and as B 2.</p>

<p>The authenticity of these works is considered to be above
reasonable suspicion; for though an emperor who reigned in
the third century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, did indeed order (<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 212) that they
should all be destroyed, yet this emperor died not long after
the issue of his edict, which was formally abrogated after twenty-two
years; and subsequent dynasties took pains to preserve
and recover the missing volumes. As it is of course improbable
that every individual would obey the frantic order of the emperor
who enjoined their destruction, there appears to be sufficient
ground for Dr. Legge's conclusion, that we possess the
actual works which were already extant in the time of Confucius,
or (in so far as they referred to him) were compiled by his
disciples or their immediate successors.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span>—<i>The Lun Yu.</i></h5>

<p>1. The first of the four Books is the Lun Yu, or "Digested
Conversations." From internal evidence it seems to have been
compiled in its actual form, not by the immediate disciples of
Confucius, but by their disciples. Its date would be "about the
end of the fourth, or beginning of the fifth, century before
Christ;" that is, about 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> It bears a nearer resemblance
to the Christian Gospels than any other book contained in the
Chinese Classics, being in fact a minute account, by admiring
hands, of the behavior, character, and doctrine, of the great
Master, Confucius. Since, however, it contains no notice of the
events of his life in chronological order, it answers much more
accurately to the description given by Papais of the "λόγι" composed
by Matthew in the Hebrew dialect than to that of any
of our canonical Gospels.</p>

<p>Biographical materials may indeed be discovered in it; but
they occur only as incidental allusions, subservient to the main
object of preserving a record of his sayings. In the minute and
painstaking mode in which this task is performed there is even
a resemblance to Boswell's "Johnson;" as in that celebrated
work, we have as it were a photographic picture of the great
man's conversation, taken by a reverent and humble follower.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393"> 393</span>
And as there is a total absence of that fondness for the marvelous
and that tendency to exaggerate the Master's powers which
so generally characterize traditional accounts of religious teachers,
we may fairly infer that we have here a trustworthy, and
in the main, accurate representation of Confucius' personality
and of his teaching. As I have largely drawn upon this work
in writing the Life of that prophet, I need not now detain the
reader with any further quotations.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>The Ta Hëo.</i></h5>

<p>Passing to the Ta Hëo, or Great Learning, we find ourselves
occupied with a book which bears the same kind of relationship
to the Lun Yu as the Epistle to the Hebrews does to the Gospels.
This work is altogether of a doctrinal character; and as
in the Epistle, the exposition of the doctrines is by no means so
clear and simple as in the oral instructions of the founder of
the school. The Ta Hëo is attributed by Chinese tradition to
K'ung Keih, the grandson of Confucius; but its authorship is in
fact, like that of the Epistle, unknown. It was added to the Le
Ke, or Record of Rites, in the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>It begins with certain paragraphs which are attributed, apparently
without authority, to Confucius; and all that follows
is supposed to be a commentary on this original text. The text
begins thus:—</p>

<p>1. "What the Great Learning teaches, is—to illustrate illustrious
virtue; to renovate the people; and to rest in the highest
excellence....</p>

<p>4. "The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue
throughout the Empire, first ordered well their own States.
Wishing to order well their States, they first regulated their
families. Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated
their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified
their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first
sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere
in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge.
Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of
things."</p>

<p>After a few more verses of text, we come to the "Commen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394"> 394</span>tary
of the philosopher Tsang," which is mainly occupied with
what purports to be an explanation of the process described in
the foregoing verses. For instance, the sixth chapter "explains
making the thoughts sincere," the seventh, "rectifying the
mind and cultivating the person;" until at last we arrive at the
right manner of conducting "the government of the State, and
the making of the Empire peaceful and happy." The object of
the treatise is therefore practical, and the subject a favorite
one with the Chinese Classics, that of Government. Great
stress is laid on the influence of a good example on the part of
the ruler; and those model sovereigns, "Yaou and Shun," are
appealed to as illustrations of its good effect in such hands as
theirs. In the course of the exposition of these principles, we
meet with dry maxims of political economy, worthy of modern
times, such as this:—</p>

<p>"There is a great course also for the production of wealth.
Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there
be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure.
Then the wealth will always be sufficient" (Ta Hëo).</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 3.</span>—<i>The Chung Yung.</i></h5>

<p>The composition of the Chung Yung, or "Doctrine of the
Mean," is universally attributed in China to K'ung Keih, or
Tsze-sze, the grandson of Confucius. The external evidence of
his authorship is, in Dr. Legge's opinion, sufficient; though if
that which he has produced be all that is extant, it does not
seem to be at all conclusive. Some quotations from it have
already been made in the notice of Confucius, many of whose
utterances are contained in it.</p>

<p>Its principal object is, or seems to be, to inculcate the excellence
of what is called "the Mean," but the explanation of
what is intended by the Mean is far from clear. The course of
the Mean, however, is that taken by the sage; the virtue which
is according to the Mean is perfect; the superior man embodies
it in his practice; ordinary men cannot keep to it; mean men
act contrary to it; and Shun, a model emperor, "determined
the Mean" between the bad and good elements in men, "and
employed it in his government of the people." The Mean, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395"> 395</span>
the attributes thus assigned to it, would appear to be a state of
complete and hardly attainable moral perfection, of which they
who have offered an example in their conduct have (at least in
modern times) been rare indeed. In the beginning of the
treatise we learn that:—</p>

<p>1. "What Heaven has conferred is called <span class="allsmcap">THE NATURE</span>; an accordance
with this nature is called <span class="allsmcap">THE PATH</span> <i>of duty</i>; the regulation
of this path is called <span class="smcap">Instruction</span>."</p>

<p>4. "While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow
or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of <span class="smcap">Equilibrium</span>.
When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their
due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of <span class="smcap">Harmony</span>.
This <span class="smcap">Equilibrium</span> is the great root <i>from which grow all
the human actings</i> in the world, and this <span class="smcap">Harmony</span> is the universal
path <i>which they all should pursue</i>" (The italics, here and in
future quotations, are in Legge).</p>

<p>5. "Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection,
and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and
earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish" (Chung
Yung).</p>

<p>In another part of the work, "the path" is described as not
being "far from the common indications of consciousness;"
and the following rule is laid down with regard to it:—</p>

<p>"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his
nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he
is not far from the path. What you do not like, when done to
yourself, do not do to others" (Ibid., xiii. 3).</p>

<p>A large and important portion of the goodness required of
those who would walk in the path is sincerity. Sincerity is
declared to be the "way of Heaven" (Ibid., xx. 18), and it is
laid down that "it is only he who is possessed of the most complete
sincerity that can exist under Heaven, who can give its
full development to his nature." Having this power, he is said
to be able to give development to the natures of other men,
animals, and things, and even "to assist the transforming and
nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth," so that "he may
with Heaven and Earth form a ternion" (Chung Yung, xx. 7).</p>

<p>The doctrine of "Heaven" as a protecting power holds no
inconsiderable place in this short treatise. Thus it is stated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396"> 396</span>
that "Heaven, in the production of things, is surely bountiful to
them, according to their qualities" (Ibid., xvii. 3). "In order
to know men" the sovereign "may not dispense with a knowledge
of Heaven" (Ibid., xxii). "The way of Heaven and Earth
may be completely declared in one sentence. They are without
any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner that is
unfathomable.</p>

<p>"The way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial,
high and brilliant, far reaching and long enduring" (Chung Yung,
xxvi. 7, 8).</p>

<p>And in a very high-flown passage on the character of the
sage—said to refer to the author's grandfather—he is spoken
of as "the equal of Heaven" (Ibid., xxxi. 3).</p>

<p>Heaven, however, is not the only superhuman power that is
mentioned in the Chung Yung. In one of its chapters we are
told that Confucius thus expressed himself:—</p>

<p>"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers
that belong to them!</p>

<p>"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but
do not hear them; yet they enter into all things, and there is
nothing without them.</p>

<p>"They cause all the people in the Empire to fast and purify
themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in
order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water,
they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left <i>of
their worshipers</i>" (Chung Yung, xvi. 1-3).</p>

<p>This positive expression of opinion is scarcely consistent
with the habitual reserve of Kung-tse on subjects of this kind
(Lun Yu, vii. 20), and were it not that it rests apparently on
adequate authority, we might be tempted to reject it as apocryphal.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 4.</span>—<i>The works of Mang-tsze.</i></h5>

<p>The next place in the Chinese Scriptures is occupied by the
works of Mang-tsze, the philosopher Mang, or as he is frequently
called, Mencius. Mang lived nearly two hundred
years later than Confucius, having been born about 371, and
having died in 288 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> He was not an original teacher asserting
independent authority, and has no claim to the title of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397"> 397</span>
prophet. On the contrary, he was an avowed disciple of Confucius,
to whose <i>dicta</i> he paid implicit reverence, and whom he
quoted with the respect due to the exalted character which the
sage had already acquired in the eyes of his school.</p>

<p>The so-called "Works of Mang" are not original compositions
of this philosopher, but collections of his sayings, resembling
the Lun Yu, or Confucian Analects. Whether he compiled
them, or took any part in their compilation himself, is
uncertain. But, considering their character, the more probable
hypothesis seems to be that they were committed to writing by
his friends, or disciples, either during his own life, or immediately
after his death.</p>

<p>The evidence of their antiquity and authenticity must be very
briefly touched upon. The earliest notice of Mang is antecedent
to the Ts'in dynasty (255-206 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>), that is, within thirty-three
years after his death. We are indebted for it to Seun K'ing,
who "several times makes mention of" Mang, and who in one
chapter of his works, "quotes his arguments and endeavors
to set them aside." In the next place, we have accounts of
him, and references to his writings, in K'ung Foo, prior to the
Han dynasty, that is, before 206 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Thirdly, he is quoted by
writers from 186-178 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, under the Han dynasty. About 100
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> occurs the earliest mention now known of Mang's works.
It emanates from Sze-ma Tseen, who attributes to Mang himself
the composition of "seven books." While in a category of
the date <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1, the works of Mang are entered as being "in
eleven books;" a discrepancy which has given rise to perplexities
among Chinese scholars, with which we need not concern
ourselves. Suffice it to say, that Mang's works, as we now possess
them, consist only of seven books, and are not known to
have ever consisted of more.</p>

<p>This evidence would appear to be sufficient to prove the
antiquity of the collection, though not its Mencian authorship.
Whoever may have been its author, it was not admitted among
the Sacred Books till many centuries after it had been received
among scholars as a valuable, though not classical, work. Under
the Sung dynasty, which began to reign about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 960-970, the
works of Mang were at length placed on a level with the Lun
Yu, as part of the great Bible of China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398"> 398</span></p>

<p>On the whole, Mang's writings are of little interest for European
readers, and I shall not trouble mine with any elaborate
account of them. They are mainly occupied with the question
of the good government of the Empire. What constitutes a
good ruler? on what principles should the administration of
public affairs be carried on? how can the people be rendered
happy and the whole Empire prosperous? these are the sort of
inquiries that chiefly engaged the attention of Mang, and to
which he sought to furnish satisfactory replies. At the courts
of the monarchs who received him, he inculcated benevolent
conduct towards their subjects, with a paternal regard for their
welfare, and sometimes boldly reproved unjust or negligent
rulers. Holding, in common with the rest of his school, the
doctrine of a superintendence of human affairs by a power
named Heaven, he asserted in uncompromising terms the theory
that Heaven expresses its will through the instrumentality of
the people at large. "Vox populi, vox Dei," is the sentiment
that animates the following passage, which contains one of the
most courageous assertions of popular rights to be found in the
productions of any age or country:—</p>

<p>"Wan Chang said, 'Was it the case that Yaou gave the
empire to Shun?'<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Mencius said, 'No. The emperor cannot
give the empire to another.'</p>

<p>"'Yes;—but Shun had the empire. Who gave it to him?'</p>

<p>"'Heaven gave it to him,' was the answer.</p>

<p>"'Heaven gave it to him:—did <i>Heaven</i> confer its appointment
on him with specific injunctions?'</p>

<p>"<i>Mencius</i> replied, 'No. Heaven does not speak. It simply
showed its will by his personal conduct, and his conduct of
affairs.'</p>

<p>"'It showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct
of affairs:—how was this?' Mencius' answer was, 'The empire
[? emperor] can present a man to Heaven, but he cannot make
Heaven give that man the empire. A prince can present a man
to the emperor, but he cannot cause the emperor to make that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399"> 399</span>
man a prince. A great officer can present a man to his prince,
but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great officer.
Yaou presented Shun to Heaven, and the people accepted
him. Therefore I say, Heaven does not speak. It simply indicated
its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.'</p>

<p>"<i>Chang</i> said, 'I presume to ask how it was that <i>Yaou</i> presented
<i>Shun</i> to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him; and that he
exhibited him to the people, and the people accepted him."
<i>Mencius</i> replied, 'He caused him to preside over the sacrifices,
and all the spirits were well pleased with them;—thus Heaven
accepted him. He caused him to preside over the conduct of
affairs, and affairs were well administered, so that the people
reposed under him;—thus the people accepted him. Heaven
gave <i>the empire</i> to him. The people gave it to him. Therefore
I said, The emperor cannot give the empire to another.</p>

<p>"'Shun assisted Yaou in the government for twenty and
eight years;—this was more than man could have done, and
was from Heaven. After the death of Yaou, when the three
years' mourning was completed, Shun withdrew from the son
of Yaou to the south of South river. The princes of the empire,
however, repairing to court, went not to the son of Yaou, but
they went to Shun. Singers sang not the son of Yaou, but they
sang Shun. Therefore I said, Heaven <i>gave him the empire</i>. It
was after these things that he went to the Middle kingdom, and
occupied the emperor's seat. If he had, <i>before these things</i>,
taken up his residence in the palace of Yaou, and had applied
pressure to the son of Yaou, it would have been an act of usurpation,
and not the gift of Heaven.</p>

<p>"'This sentiment is expressed in the words of The great
Declaration,—<i>Heaven sees according as my people see; Heaven
hears according as my people hear</i>'" (The Italics are mine.—Mang-tsze,
b. 5, pt. i. ch. v.).</p>

<p>Mang's notion of what a really good government should do
is fully explained at the end of the first part of the first book,
in an exhortation to the king of Ts'e. His Majesty, he observed,
should "institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent,"
for then his kingdom will be resorted to by officers
of the court, farmers, merchants, and persons who are aggrieved
by their own rulers. The king must take care "to regulate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400"> 400</span>
livelihood of people," in order that all may have enough for
parents, wives, and children; for "they are only men of education,
who without a certain livelihood, are able to maintain
a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain
livelihood, it follows that they will not have a fixed
heart. And if they have not a fixed heart, there is nothing
which they will not do, in the way of self-abandonment, of
moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license. When they
have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish
them,—this is to entrap the people. How can such a thing
as entrapping the people be done under the rule of a benevolent
man?" With a view then to their material and moral
well-being, mulberry trees should be planted, the breeding seasons
of domestic animals be carefully attended to, the labor
necessary to cultivate farms not be interfered with, and "careful
attention paid to education in schools." And it has never
been known that the ruler in whose State these things were
duly performed "did not attain to the Imperial dignity" (Mang-tsze,
b. 1, pt. i. ch. vii. p. 18-24). The only virtue required for
"the attainment of Imperial sway" is "the love and protection
of the people; with this there is no power which can prevent a
ruler from attaining it" (Ibid., b. 1, pt. i. ch. vii. p. 3). In accordance
with his decided opinions as to the right of the people
to be consulted in the appointment of their rulers, he advised
the same king to be guided entirely by popular feeling in
assuming, or not assuming, the government of a neighboring
territory which he had conquered. "If the people of Yen will
be pleased with your taking possession of it, then do so....
If the people of Yen will not be pleased with your taking possession
of it, then do not do so" (Mang-tsze, b. 1, pt. ii. ch. x.
p. 3).</p>

<p>Mang was something of a political economist as well as a
statesman. There is in his writings a just and striking defense
of the division of labor, in opposition to the primitive simplicity
recommended by a man named Heu Hing, who wished the
rulers to cultivate the soil with their own hands. Mang's
answer to Heu Hing's disciple is in the form of an <i>ad hominem</i>
argument, showing that, as Heu Hing himself does not manufacture
his own clothes or make his own pots and pans, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401"> 401</span>
obtains them in exchange for grain, in order that all his time
may be devoted to agriculture, it is absurd to suppose that
government is the only business which can advantageously be
pursued along with husbandry, as Heu Hing desired (Mang-tsze,
b. 1, pt. ii. ch. x. p. 3).</p>

<p>It was not enough, however, in Mang's eyes that a sovereign
should conduct the government of his country in accordance
with the great ethical and economical maxims he laid down;
he must also pay strict attention to the rules of Chinese etiquette.
On some occasions Mang insisted even haughtily on
the observance towards himself of these rules by the princes who
wished to see him, even though one of his own disciples plainly
told him that in refusing to visit them because of their supposed
failure to attend to such minutiæ he seemed to him to
be "standing on a small point" (Ibid., b. 3, pt. i. ch. iv). In
fact the "rules of propriety" held in his estimation no less a
place than in that of his Master and predecessor. It is gratifying,
however, to find him admitting that cases may arise where
their operation should be suspended. Indecorous as it is for
males and females to "allow their hands to touch in giving or
receiving anything," yet when "a man's sister-in-law" is drowning
he is permitted, and indeed bound to, "rescue her with the
hand." Nay, Mang in his liberality goes further, and emphatically
observes, that "he who would not so rescue a drowning
woman is a wolf" (Mang-tsze, b. 4, pt. i. ch. xvii. p. 1).</p>

<p>The most important doctrine of a moral character dwelt
upon by Mang is that of the essential goodness of human
nature, on which he lays considerable stress. According to him,
"the tendency of man's nature to good is like the tendency of
water to flow downwards," and it is shared by all, as all water
flows downwards. You may indeed force water to go upwards
by striking it, but the movement is unnatural, and it is equally
contrary to the nature of men to be "made to do what is not
good" (Ibid., b. 6, pt. i. ch. ii. pp. 2, 3). Yaou and Shun were
indeed great men, but all may be Yaous and Shuns, if only they
will make the necessary effort (Ibid., b. 6, pt. ii. ch. ii. pp. 1-5).
"<i>Men's</i> mouths agree in having the same relishes; their ears
agree in enjoying the same sounds; their eyes agree in recognizing
the same beauty;—shall their minds alone be without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402"> 402</span>
that which they similarly approve? What is it then of which
they similarly approve? It is, I say, the principles <i>of our
nature</i>, and the determinations of righteousness. The sages only
apprehended before me that of which my mind approves along
with other men. Therefore the principles of our nature and the
determinations of righteousness are agreeable to my mind, just
as the flesh of grass [?-fed] and grain-fed animals is agreeable
to my mouth" (Mang-tsze, b. 6, pt. i. ch. vii. p. 8). It ought
not to be said that any man's mind is without benevolence and
righteousness. But men lose their goodness as "the trees are
denuded by axes and bills." The mind, "hewn down day after
day," cannot "retain its beauty." But "the calm air of the
morning" is favorable to the natural feelings of humanity,
though they are destroyed again by the influences men come
under during the day. "This fettering takes place again and
again," and as "the restorative influence of the night" is insufficient
to preserve the native hue, "the nature becomes not
much different from that of the irrational animals," and then
people suppose it never had these original powers of goodness.
"But does this condition," continues Mang, "represent the
feelings proper to humanity?" (Ibid., b. 6, pt. i. ch. viii. p. 2).
What some of these feelings are he has plainly told us. Commiseration,
shame, and dislike, modesty and complaisance,
approbation and disapprobation, are according to him four principles
which men have just as they have their four limbs. The
important point for all men to attend to is their development,
for if they are but completely developed, "they will suffice to
love and protect all within the four seas" (Ibid., b. 2, pt. i. ch.
vi. pp. 5-7). And in another place he insists on the importance
of studying and cultivating the nature which he asserts to be
thus instinctively virtuous. "He who has exhausted all his
mental constitution knows his nature. Knowing his nature, he
knows Heaven.</p>

<p>"To preserve one's mental constitution, and nourish one's
nature, is the way to serve Heaven" (Ibid., b. 7, pt. i. ch. i. pp. 1, 2).</p>

<p>The moral tone of Mang's writings is exalted and unbending,
and evinces a man whose character will bear comparison with
those of the greatest philosophers or most eminent Christians
of the western world.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 5.</span>—<i>The Shoo King.</i></h5>

<p>In this work are contained the historical memorials of the
Chinese Empire. The authentic history of China extends, as is
well known, to an earlier date than that of any extant nation.
It possesses records of events that occurred more than two
thousand years before the Christian era, although these events
are intermixed with fabulous incidents. "From the time of
T'ang the Successful, however," Dr. Legge informs us, "commonly
placed in the eighteenth century before Christ, we seem
to be able to tread the field of history with a somewhat confident
step" (C. C., vol. iii. Proleg., p. 48). The exact dates, however,
cannot be fixed with certainty till the year 775 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>
"Twenty centuries before our era the Chinese nation appears,
beginning to be" (Ibid., p. 90).</p>

<p>Without entering into the history of the text of the Shoo
King, it may be stated that its fifty-eight books may probably
be accepted as "substantially the same with those which were
known to Seun-tsze, Mencius, Mih-tsze, Confucius himself, and
others" (C. C., vol. iii. Proleg., p. 48).</p>

<p>Its earliest books—which must be regarded as in great part
legendary—contain accounts of three Chinese Emperors—Yaou,
Shun, and Yu—whose conduct is held up as a model to future
ages, and who represent the <i>beau idéal</i> of a ruler to the Chinese
mind.</p>

<p>These admirable sovereigns were succeeded by men of very
inferior virtue. T'ae-k'ang (<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 2187), the grandson of Yu,
"pursued his pleasure and wanderings without any restraint."
An insurrection against his authority took place, and his five
brothers took occasion to admonish him by repeating "the
cautions of the great Yu in the form of songs." The first of
these songs may be quoted as a good specimen of the doctrine
of the Shoo King with reference to the imperial duties:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many successive dynasties, comprising sovereigns of various
characters, succeed these original Emperors. Throughout the
Shoo King we find great stress laid on the doctrine, that the
rulers of the land enjoy the protection of Heaven only so long
as their government is good. Should the prince become tyrannical,
dissolute, or neglectful of his exalted duties, the favor of
the Divine Power is withdrawn from him and conferred upon
another, who is thus enabled to drive him from the throne he
is no longer worthy to fill. The emphatic and reiterated assertion
of this revolutionary theory is very remarkable. Thus, a
king who has himself just effected the overthrow of an incompetent
dynasty, is represented as addressing this discourse to
the "myriad regions:"—</p>

<p>"Ah! ye multitudes of the myriad regions, listen clearly to
the announcement of me, the one man. The great God has
conferred <i>even</i> on the inferior people a moral sense, compliance
with which would show their nature invariably right (the same
doctrine insisted on by Mang). <i>But</i> to cause them tranquilly to
pursue the course which it would indicate, is the work of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>"The king of Hea (the monarch whom the speaker had
superseded,) extinguished his virtue and played the tyrant, extending
his oppression over you, the people of the myriad
regions. Suffering from his cruel injuries, and unable to endure
the wormwood and poison, you protested with one accord your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405"> 405</span>
innocence to the spirits of heaven and earth. The way of
Heaven is to bless the good and punish the bad. It sent down
calamities on <i>the House of</i> Hea, to make manifest its crimes.</p>

<p>"Therefore I, the little child, charged with the decree of
Heaven and its bright terrors, did not dare to forgive <i>the criminal</i>.
I presume to use a dark-colored victim, and making clear
announcement to the spiritual Sovereign of the high heavens,
requested leave to deal with the ruler of Hea as a criminal.
Then I sought for the great sage, with whom I might unite my
strength, to request the favor of Heaven on behalf of you, my
multitudes. High Heaven truly showed its favor to the inferior
people, and the criminal has been degraded and subjected"
(Shoo King, iv. 3. 2).</p>

<p>It is true that this speech, proceeding from an interested
party naturally anxious to set his own conduct in the fairest
light, is liable to suspicion. But there is abundant evidence in
the pages of the Shoo King that the views expressed above were
participated in by its writers, who constantly hold the fate that
befalls wicked Emperors as a punishment from Heaven, and
laud those who effect their own downfall as Heaven's agents.
They also frequently introduce sage advisers who reprove the
reigning Emperor for his faults, and admonish him to walk in
the ways of virtue in a spirit of the utmost frankness. One of
these monarchs candidly confesses the benefit he has derived
from the instructions of such a counselor, whose lessons have
led him to effect a complete reformation of his character (Ibid.,
iv. 5. pt. ii). Another charged his minister to be constantly
presenting instructions to aid his virtue, and to act towards him
as medicine which should cure his sickness (Ibid., iv. 8. pt. i.
5-8). If, however, a dynasty persisted in its evil courses, in
spite of all the warnings it might receive, it was doomed to
perish. Losing the attachment of the people, it fell undefended
and unregretted. Such was the case with the house of Yin.
The Viscount of Wei, who is stated by old authorities to have
been a brother of the Emperor, thus described its career:—</p>

<p>"The Viscount of Wei spoke to the following effect:—'Grand
Tutor and Junior Tutor, <i>the House of</i> Yin, we may conclude,
can no longer exercise rule over the four quarters of the
empire. The great deeds of our founder were displayed in for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406"> 406</span>mer
ages, but by our being lost and maddened with wine, we
have destroyed <i>the effects of</i> his virtue, in these after times.
The people of Yin, small and great, are given to highway robberies,
villainies, and treachery. The nobles and officers imitate
one another in violating the laws; and for criminals there
is no certainty that they will be apprehended. The lesser people
<i>consequently</i> rise up, and make violent outrages on one another.
The dynasty of Yin is now sinking in ruin;—its condition is
like that of one crossing a large stream, who can find neither
ford nor bank. That Yin should be hurrying to ruin at the
present pace!'—</p>

<p>"He added, 'Grand Tutor and Junior Tutor, we are manifesting
insanity. The venerable of our families have withdrawn
to the wilds; and now you indicate nothing, but tell me of the
impending ruin;—what is to be done?'</p>

<p>"The Grand Tutor made about the following reply:—'King's
son, Heaven in anger is sending down calamities, and wasting
the country of Yin.'" And after mentioning the crimes of the
Emperor, he proceeds:—"'When ruin overtakes Shang, I will
not be the servant <i>of another dynasty</i>. <i>But</i> I tell you, O king's
son, to go away as being the course <i>for you</i>.... Let us
rest quietly in our several parts, and present ourselves to the
former kings. I do not think of making my escape'" (Shoo
King, iv. 11).</p>

<p>In another portion of the Shoo the causes which lead to the
preservation or loss of Heaven's favor are thus described by
"The Duke of Chow:"—"The favor of Heaven is not easily preserved.
Heaven is hard to be depended on. Men lose its favoring
appointment because they cannot pursue and carry out
the reverence and brilliant virtue of their forefathers." Again:—"Heaven
is not to be trusted. Our course is simply to seek
the prolongation of the virtue of the Tranquilizing king, and
Heaven will not find occasion to remove its favoring decree
which King Wan received" (Shoo King, xvi. 1).</p>

<p>The paramount importance to the national welfare of a wise
selection of ministers and officials receives its full share of
attention in the Chinese Bible. The Duke of Ts'in, another
province of the Empire, is represented as speaking thus:—</p>

<p>"I have deeply thought and concluded;—Let me have but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407"> 407</span>
one resolute minister, plain and sincere, without other abilities,
but having a simple, complacent mind, and possessed of generosity,
regarding the talents of others, as if he himself possessed
them: and when he finds accomplished and sage-like men, loving
them in his heart more than his mouth expresses, really
showing himself able to bear them:—such a minister would be
able to preserve my descendants and my people, and would
indeed be a giver of benefits" (Shoo King, v. 30. See also v.
19. 2).</p>

<p>These extracts, without giving an adequate notion of the
very miscellaneous contents of the Shoo King, a work which
could not be accomplished without an undue extension of the
subdivision referring to it, will serve to show that its moral
tone on matters relating to the government of a nation is not
inferior to that of any of the productions of classical or Hebrew
antiquity.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 6.</span>—<i>The She King.</i></h5>

<p>Whatever sanctity or authority may attach to the She King
in the minds of the Chinese, must belong to it solely on account
of its antiquity, for there is certainly nothing in the character
of its contents that should entitle it to a place in the consecrated
literature of a nation. Similar phenomena, however, are not
unknown among more devout races than the Chinese. Thus
the Hebrews admitted into their Canon the Books of Ruth and
Esther, and the Song of Solomon, which contain but little of an
edifying nature, though full of human interest. The same may
be said of the She King. The play of human emotions is vividly
represented in it, but there is not much in which moral or
religious lessons are to be found, except by doing violence to
the text.</p>

<p>The She King is a collection of ancient poems. Tradition
attributes the arrangement and selection of the Odes now contained
in it to Confucius, who is supposed to have selected
them in accordance with some wise design from a much larger
number. The present translator, however, assigns reasons for
rejecting this tradition, and for believing that the She King was
current in China long before his time in a form not very different
from that in which we now possess it. At the present day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408"> 408</span>
its songs have not lost their ancient popularity, for it is stated
that they are "the favorite study of the better informed at the
present remote period. Every well-educated Chinese has the
most celebrated pieces by heart, and there are constant allusions
to them in modern poetry and writings of all kinds" (Davis'
Chinese, ii. 60).</p>

<p>The poems, which were collected from many different provinces,
relate to a great variety of subjects. Some are political,
some domestic, some sacrificial, others festive. We have rulers
addressing the princes of their kingdom in laudatory terms, and
princes in their turn extolling the ruler; complaints of unemployed
politicians, and groans from oppressed subjects; husbands
deploring their absence from their wives on military service;
forlorn wives longing for the return of absent husbands;
stanzas written by lovers to their mistresses, and maidens' invocations
of their lovers; along with a few allusions to amatory
transactions of a more questionable character. All these miscellaneous
matters are treated in short, simple, and rather monotonous
poems, which, if they have any beauty in the original,
have completely lost it in the process of translation. There is
sometimes pathos in the feelings uttered; but the expressions
are of the most direct and unornamental kind, and the whole
book partakes largely of that artlessness which we have noted
as one of the ordinary marks of Sacred Books.</p>

<p>A few specimens will suffice. Here is the "protest of a
widow against being urged to marry again:"—</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 7.</span>—<i>The Ch'un Ts'ëw.</i></h5>

<p>According to Chinese tradition, the Ch'un Ts'ëw, or Spring
and Autumn, was the production of Confucius himself; not
indeed his original composition, but a compilation made by him
from preëxisting sources. The title of Ch'un Ts'ëw was not of
his own making. It was the name already in use for the annals
of the several States. The annals were arranged under the four
seasons of each year, and then two of the seasons—Spring and
Autumn—were used as an abbreviated term for all the four.
And so strictly is this principle of parceling out the annals of
each year under the several seasons adhered to in the work,
that even when there is no event to be recorded we have such
entries as these: "It was summer, the fourth month." "It
was winter, the tenth month."</p>

<p>The classical Ch'un Ts'ëw was compiled from the Ch'un
Ts'ëw of the State of Loo. It is even doubtful whether Confucius
did anything more than copy what he found in the annals
of that country. Dr. Legge evidently inclines to the belief that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411"> 411</span>
he altered nothing. At any rate, the work can only be regarded
as very particularly his own. More than this, it is questionable
whether the text we have at present is that of the original
Ch'un Ts'ëw at all. This classic is indeed said to have been
recovered in the Han dynasty after the destruction of the
book. But there are circumstances which may well make us
hesitate before we accept the Chinese account of this recovery
as a fact. Mang, who had the best opportunities of knowing
what his master was believed to have written, if not what he
actually had written, speaks of the Ch'un Ts'ëw in terms
wholly inapplicable to the work before us. He asserts expressly
that it was composed by him because right principles had dwindled
away, because unseemly language and unrighteous deeds
were common, and he attributes to its completion the result
that "rebellious ministers and villainous sons were struck with
terror." Now we may allow what limits we please for the exaggeration
natural to a disciple when speaking of the labors of
a revered master. But can we believe that Mang, a man whose
own teaching proves him to have been a moderate and sensible
thinker, would have spoken thus of a compilation which from
beginning to end contains absolutely no moral principles whatever?
Yet such is the case with the "Spring and Autumn" as
we possess it. There is not in it the faintest glimmer of an
ethical judgment on the historical events which it records. A
birth, an eclipse, a fall of snow, a plague of insects, a murder,
a battle, the death of a ruler, are all chronicled in the same
dry, lifeless, unvarying style. Nowhere would it be possible for
an unprejudiced critic to detect the opinions of the compiler, or
to gather from his words that he viewed a virtuous action with
more favor than an abominable crime. Such being the case, I
hesitate, notwithstanding the high authority of Dr. Legge, to
accept the genuineness of this work as beyond cavil.</p>

<p>It has in fact been questioned in China, not indeed on very
valid grounds, by a scholar whose letter he has translated in
his Prolegomena, and he himself candidly acknowledges the
extreme difficulty of reconciling the character of our present text
with the statement of Mang. But he considers the external testimony
to the recovery of the book sufficiently weighty to dispose
of this and other difficulties. Yet, without disputing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412"> 412</span>
strength of the grounds on which this conclusion rests, we may
still permit ourselves to entertain a modest doubt whether this
compilation was really the handiwork of such a man as we
know Confucius to have been, and that doubt will be strengthened
when we recall the common tendency of the popular mind
to connect the authorship of standard works with names of
high repute. And the bare existence of such a doubt will compel
us to suspend our judgment on the very serious charges of
misrepresentation and falsehood which Dr. Legge has brought
against Confucius in his capacity of historian. If the actual
Ch'un Ts'ëw be shown to be identical with that edited by Confucius,
and if he simply adopted, without alteration, or with
very trivial alteration, the labors of his predecessors, the gravity
of these charges will be very considerably diminished. For we
know not but what some feeling of respect for that which he
found already recorded may have stayed his hand from revision
and improvement.</p>

<p>Passing to the work itself, we shall find little in it worthy
of attention, unless by those who may be desirous of studying
the history of China. Chinese commentators have indeed discovered
all kinds of recondite meanings in it, as is usually the
case with the commentators on Sacred Books, but these are of
no more value than the similar discoveries of types and mystic
foreshadowings in the Hebrew Scriptures. In itself, the text is
profoundly uninteresting. Here is one of the shortest chapters
as a specimen. The title of the Book from which it is taken is
"Duke Chwang:"—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>XXVI. 1. "In his twenty-sixth year, in spring, the duke invaded
the Jung.</p>

<p>2. "In summer, the duke arrived from the invasion of the Jung.</p>

<p>3. "Ts'aou put to death one of its great officers.</p>

<p>4. "In autumn, the duke joined an officer of Sung and an officer
of Ts'e in invading Seu.</p>

<p>5. "In winter, in the twelfth month, on Kwei-hae, the first day
of the moon, the sun was eclipsed" (Ch'un Ts'ëw, iii. 26).</p>
</div>

<p>The events noted in these annals refer to various States—for
it appears that the several States were in the habit of communicating
remarkable occurrences to each other—but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413"> 413</span>
are of a very limited class, and are invariably recorded in the
brief manner of the chapter that has just been quoted. Eclipses
of the sun are duly registered, and the record thus acquires a
chronological value of high importance in historical researches.
Among the other facts commonly mentioned are sacrifices for
rain, which occur very frequently; wars, with the results of
great battles; the marriages or deaths of rulers and important
persons; their journeys; occasionally their murder; meetings
of rulers for the purpose of common action in matters of State;
diplomatic missions; invasions of locusts or other troublesome
insects; and lastly, peculiarities of various kinds in the state of
the weather. It is plain that annals of this kind have no religious
significance beyond that which they derive from the mere
fact of being reputed sacred. And in this aspect the Ch'un
Ts'ëw is certainly curious. Having been assigned—rightly or
wrongly—to the pen of the prophet of China, it seems to have
become a point of honor with Chinese scholars to extract from
it, by hook or by crook, the profoundest lessons on politics and
morals.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section II.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Taò-tĕ-Kīng.</span><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></h4>

<p>There are in China three recognized sects or "religiones
licitæ:"—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Tao-ism. We have
examined the Sacred Books of the first; those of the second
will come under review in another section. There remains the
comparatively small and unimportant sect of the Taò-tsé, or
"Doctors of Reason," who derive their origin from Laò-tsé,
and who possess as their classic the single written composition
which emanated from their founder. It is entitled the Taò-tĕ-Kīng.</p>

<p>Ancient as this book is (probably about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 520), there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414"> 414</span>
reason to doubt its authenticity.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is sufficiently guaranteed
by quotations from it which are found in authors belonging to
the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and by the fact that a scholar who
wrote in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 163 made it the subject of a commentary, which
accompanies it sentence by sentence. Nor does Chinese tradition
state that it perished in the Burning of the Books (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 212-209),
which was a measure leveled against the Confucian
school, and took place under an Emperor who was favorable to
the Taò-tsé. We may safely conclude that we are in possession
of the genuine composition of the ancient philosopher (T. T. K.,
lxxiii., lxxiv).</p>

<p>Of the three words which compose its title, King has already
been explained (Supra p. 390-391). The full meaning of Taò will
appear in the sequel: we may here term it the Absolute. Te
means Virtue; and the title would thus imply either that this
Canonical Book deals with the Absolute <i>and</i> with Virtue, or
with that kind of virtue which emanates from, and is founded
upon, a belief in and a spiritual union with the Absolute.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Whatever the signification of its name, its principal subjects
undoubtedly are Taò and Te: the Supreme Principle and human
Virtue. Let us see what is Laò-tsé's description of Taò, the
great fundamental Being on whom his whole system rests.
"Taò, if it can be pronounced, is not the eternal Taò. The
Name, if it can be named, is not the eternal Name. The Nameless
One is the foundation of Heaven and Earth; he who has a
Name is the Mother of all beings" (Ch. 1). These enigmatical
sentences open the Taò philosophy. The idea that Taò is
unnameable is a prominent one in the author's mind, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415"> 415</span>
he seems also to recognize a subordinate creative principle—like
the Gnostic Æons—which is nameable. Thus we read:
"Taò, the Eternal has no Name.... He who begins to
create, has a Name" (Ch. 32). Again: "For ever and ever it is
unnameable, and returns into non-existence." Or: "I know
not its Name; if I describe it, I call it Taò" (Ch. 25). We are
reminded of Faust's reply in Goethe:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Ich habe keinen Namen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dafür? Gefühl ist alles;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Name ist Schall und Rauch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Umnebelnd Himmelsgluth."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor is Taò only without a Name; it is sometimes described
as if devoid of all intelligible attributes. Thus, in one chapter,
we learn that it is eternally without action, and yet without
non-action (Ch. 37). Nay, the entire absence of all activity is
not unfrequently predicated of Taò, whose great merit is stated
to be complete quiescence. Taò is moreover incomprehensible,
inconceivable, undiscoverable, obscure (Ch. 21). Its upper part
is not clear, its lower part not obscure. It returns into non-existence.
It is the form of the Formless; the image of the
Imageless (Ch. 14). Mysterious as this Being is, yet in other
places attributes are ascribed to it which go far to elucidate the
author's conception of its nature. Productive energy, for instance,
is plainly attributed to Taò, for it is stated that Taò produces
one, one two, and two three, while three produces all
creatures (Ch. 32). The following account is less mystical:
"Taò produces them [creatures], its Might preserves them, its
essence forms them, its power perfects them: therefore of all
beings there is none that does not adore Taò, and honor its
Might. The adoration of Taò, the honoring of its Might, is commanded
by no one and is always spontaneous. For Taò produces
them, preserves them, brings them up, fashions them,
perfects them, ripens them, cherishes them, protects them.
To produce and not possess, to act and not expect, to bring up
and not control, this is called sublime Virtue."<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In addition
to these creative and preservative qualities, it has moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416"> 416</span>
attributes of the highest order. Thus, its Spirit is supremely
trustworthy. In it is faithfulness (Ch. 21). All beings trust to it
in order to live. When a work is completed, it does not call it its
own. Loving and nourishing all beings, it still does not lord
it over them. It is eternally without desire. All beings turn
to it, yet it does not lord it over them (Ch. 34). It is eminently
straightforward. It dwells only with those who are
not occupied with the luxuries of this world (Ch. 53). Nay, it
is altogether perfect (Ch. 25). The last assertion is found in a
chapter which, as it is probably the most important in the
book for the purpose of understanding the theology of the
author, deserves to be translated in full:—"There existed a
Being, inconceivably perfect, before Heaven and Earth arose.
So still! so supersensible! It alone remains and does not
change. It pervades all and is not endangered. It may be regarded
as the Mother of the World. I know not its name; if
I describe it, I call it Taò. Concerned to give it a Name, I call
it Great; as great, I call it Immense; as immense, I call it Distant;
as distant, I call it Returning. For Taò is great; Heaven
is great; the Earth is great; the King is also great. In the
world there are many kinds of greatness, and the King remains
one of them. The measure of Man is the earth; the measure
of earth, Heaven; the measure of Heaven, Taò; Taò's measure
itself."<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Such is the picture of Taò; but the Taò-tĕ-Kīng is much
more than a treatise on theology; it is even more conspicuously
a treatise on morals. Taò is indeed the transcendental foundation
on which the ethical superstructure is raised; but the
superstructure occupies a much more considerable space than
the foundation, and seems to have been the main practical end
for which the latter was laid down. Intermingled with the
image of Taò we find the image of the good man, or, as we
may call him, in Scriptural phraseology, the righteous man; an
ideal of perfect virtue, whom the author holds up, not as an
actual person, but as an imaginary model for the guidance of
human conduct. By putting together the scattered traits of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417"> 417</span>
character, we may arrive at a tolerable comprehension of the
author's conception of perfect goodness. In the first place, the
righteous man is in harmony in his actions with Taò; he becomes
one with Taò, and Taò rejoices to receive him (Ch. 23).
He places himself in the background, and by that very means
is brought forward (Ch. 7). He does not regard himself, and
therefore shines; he is not just to himself, and is therefore distinguished;
does not praise himself, and is therefore meritorious;
does not exalt himself, and is therefore preëminent. As
he does not dispute, none can dispute with him (Ch. 22). If he
acts, he sets no store by his action; for he does not wish to
render his wisdom conspicuous (Ch. 77). He knows himself, but
does not regard himself; loves himself, but does not set a high
price on himself (Ch. 72). Unwilling lightly to promise great
things, he is thereby able to accomplish the more; by treating
things as difficult, he finds nothing too difficult during his
whole life (Ch. 63). Inaccessible alike to friendship and enmity,
uninfluenced by personal advantage or injury, by honor or dishonor,
he is honored by all the world (Ch. 56). He is characterized
by quiet earnestness; should he possess splendid palaces,
he inhabits them or quits them with equal calm (Ch. 26). He
clothes himself in wool (a very coarse material in China), and
hides his jewels (Ch. 70). He is ever ready to help others; for
the good man is the educator of the bad, the bad man the
treasure of the good (Ch. 27). "The righteous man does not accumulate.
The more he spends on others, the more he has; the
more he gives to others, the richer he is" (Ch. 81). "He who
knows others is clever; he who knows himself is enlightened"
(Ch. 33). Thus the sage, like Socrates, makes νῶθι σéαντον a
main principle of his conduct. Should he be called to the
administration of the realm, he adopts a policy of <i>laisser faire</i>,
for he has observed the evils produced by over-legislation. It
is his belief that if he be inactive, the people will improve by
themselves; if he be quiet, they will become honorable; if he
abstain from intermeddling, they will become rich; if he be
free from desires, they will become simple (Ch. 57). Compelled
to engage in war, he will not make use of conquest to
triumph or exalt himself, neither will he take violent measures
(Ch. 30). Mercy is a quality that must not be despised; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418"> 418</span>
merciful will conquer in battle (Ch. 67). Endowed with these
characteristics, the good man need fear nothing. Like Horace's</p>

<p class="center">
"Integer vitæ scelerisque purus,"<br />
</p>

<p class="pnind">he is preserved from danger. The horn of the rhinoceros, the
claws of the tiger, the blade of the sword, cannot hurt him
(Ch. 50). He is like a new-born child: serpents do not sting it,
nor wild beasts seize it, nor birds of prey attack it.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>A few features, which do not directly enter into the delineation
of the character of the sage, must still be added to complete
that image. And first, a prominent place must be assigned
to a quality which is a large ingredient in Laò-tsé's conception
of goodness, both human and divine. It is that of gentleness,
or, as he would call it, weakness. It is a favorite principle of
his, that the weak things of the earth overcome the strong,
and that they overcome in virtue of that very weakness. He
has an aversion to all conspicuous exercise of force. The deity
of his philosophy is one who is indeed all-powerful, but who
never displays his power. The method of Heaven—and it
should also be that of man—is <i>apparent</i> yielding, leading to
real supremacy. "It strives not, yet is able to overcome. It
speaks not, yet is able to obtain an answer. It summons not,
yet men come to it of their own accord; is long-suffering, yet
is able to succeed in its designs" (Ch. 73). The superiority of
the weak—or the seeming weak—to the strong, is further illustrated
by Laò-tsé in several parallels. We enter life soft and
feeble; we quit it hard and strong. Therefore softness and
feebleness are the companions of life; hardness and strength of
death (Ch. 76). And does not the wife overcome her husband
by her quietness? (Ch., 61.) Is not water the softest and weakest
of all things in the world, yet is there anything which ever
attacks the hard and strong that is able to surpass it? (Ch., 78.)
Thus, the most yielding of all substances overcomes the most
inflexible. Hence is manifest the advantage of inactivity and
of silence (Ch. 43). It is fully in accordance with these notions
that Laò-tsé should distinctly deprecate warfare, and should
assert that the most competent general will not be warlike.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419"> 419</span>
Calmly conscious of his power, he is not quarrelsome or eager
for battle, and thus possessing the virtue of peaceable and
patient strength, he becomes the peer of Heaven (Ch. 68). War
is altogether to be condemned, as pregnant with calamity to
the state (Ch. 30). "The most beauteous weapons are instruments
of misfortune; all creatures abhor them; therefore he
who has Taò does not employ them." They are not the instruments
of the wise man. If he must needs resort to them, yet
he still values peace and quietness as the highest aims. He
conquers with reluctance. "He who has killed many men, let
him weep for them with grief and compassion. He who has conquered
in battle, let him stand as at a funeral pomp" (Ch. 31).</p>

<p>Another striking characteristic of Laò-tsé's moral system is
his dislike of luxury, and his earnest injunction to all men to
be contented with modest circumstances. We have seen that
the sage is depicted as wearing coarse clothing, and Laò-tsé
considers that the very presence of considerable riches indicates
the absence of Taò from the minds of their possessors. As we
should express it, the devotion to worldly wealth is inconsistent
with a spiritual life. "To wear fine clothes, to carry sharp
swords, to be filled with drink and victuals, to have a superfluity
of costly gems, this is to make a parade of robbery (Or, this
is "magnificent robbery," O. P., p. 41); truly not to have Taò"
(Ch. 53). Moreover, the very pomp of the palace leads to uncultivated
fields and empty barns (Ibid). Laò-tsé therefore
warns every one not to consider his abode too narrow or his
life too confined. If we do not think it too confined, it will not
be so (Ch. 72). Nay, he goes further, and asserts that the
world is best known by staying at home. The further a man
goes, the less he knows (Ch. 47). A truly virtuous and well-governed
people will never care to travel beyond its own limits.
To such a people its food will be so sweet, its clothing so beautiful,
its dwellings so comfortable, and its customs so dear, that
it will never visit the territory of its neighbors, even though
that territory should lie so close that the cackling of the hens
and the barking of the dogs may be heard across the boundary
(Ch. 80).</p>

<p>It results from the above exposition of his ethical principles
that Laò-tsé insists mainly upon three virtues: Modesty, Benev<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420"> 420</span>olence,
and Contentment. "For my part," he says himself,
"I have three treasures; I guard them and greatly prize them.
The first is called Mercy,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the second is called Frugality, the
third is called Not daring to be first in the kingdom. Mercy—therefore
I can be brave; Frugality—therefore I can give away;
Not daring to be first in the kingdom—therefore I can become
the first of the gifted ones" (Ch. 67).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of all the sacred books, the Taò-tĕ-Kīng is the most philosophical.
It stands, indeed, on the borderland between a revelation
and a system of philosophy, partaking to some extent
of the nature of both. Since, however, it forms the fundamental
classic of a religious sect, and since it has engaged in its interpretation
a multitude of commentators,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> it appears to be fully
entitled to a place among Scriptures. Not indeed that the Chinese
regard it as a revelation in the same sense in which nations
of a more theological cast of mind apply that term to the books
composing their Canon. But I see no reason to doubt that the
Taò-tsé, however little they attend to its precepts, yet treat it
as a work of unapproachable perfection and unquestionable
truth. Indeed, the writer of a fabulous life of Laò-tsé, who
lived many centuries after his death, expressly ascribes to it
those peculiar qualities which, as we have seen, are the special
attributes of sacred books (L. V. V., pp. xxxi., xxxii).</p>

<p>To the European reader who approaches it for the first time
it will probably appear a perplexing study. Participating largely
in that disorder and confusedness which characterizes the class
of literature to which it belongs, it presents, in addition, considerable
difficulties peculiarly its own. The correct translation
of many passages is doubtful. The sense of still more is ambiguous
and obscure. Laò-tsé is fond of paradox, and his constant
employment of paradoxical antithesis seems specially designed
to puzzle the reader. If his doctrine was understood by few, it
must be confessed that this was partly his own fault. More<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421"> 421</span>over,
the reverence with which he speaks of Taò, and the care
with which he insists that Taò does nothing, seem at first sight
inconsistent. We feel ourselves in an atmosphere of hopeless
mysticism. Nevertheless, these superficial troubles vanish, or
at least retire into the background, after repeated perusals of
the work. There are few books that gain more on continued
acquaintance. Every successive study reveals more and more
of a wisdom and a beauty which we miss at first in the obscurity
and strangeness of the style.</p>

<p>And first, Taò itself turns out to be a less incomprehensible
and contradictory being than we originally supposed. For
although he may sometimes be spoken of as doing nothing, or
even as destitute of all distinct qualities, yet other attributes
expressly exclude the notion of absolute inaction. A being
which creates, cherishes and loves, and in which all the world
implicitly trusts, is not the kind of nonentity that can be described
as wholly devoid of "action, thought, judgment, and
intelligence."<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that the
sage is to imitate Taò in the quality—for which he is highly
lauded—of doing nothing. The two pictures, that of Taò and
his follower, must be held side by side in order to be correctly
understood. Now what is the peculiar beauty, from a philosophical
point of view, of the order of Nature? It is that all
its parts harmoniously perform their several offices, without
any violent or conspicuous intrusion of the presiding principle
which guides them all.</p>

<p>Other teachers, indeed, have seen God mainly in violent and
convulsive manifestations, and have appealed to miraculous
suspensions of natural order as the best proofs of his existence.
Not so Laò-tsé. He sees him in the quiet, unobtrusive,
unapparent guidance of the world; in the unseen, yet irresistible
power to which mankind unresistingly submit, precisely
because it is never thrust offensively upon them. The Deity of
Laò-tsé is free from those gross and unlovely elements which
degrade his character in so many other religions. He rules by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422"> 422</span>
gentleness and love, not by vindictiveness and anger. So should
it be with the holy man who takes him for his model. Assuredly
we are not to understand those passages which enjoin
quiescence so earnestly upon him as a meaning that he is to
lead a life of absolute indolence. Like Taò, he is to guide
his fellow-creatures rather by the beauty of his conduct than
by positive commands laid imperatively upon them. Let him
but be a shining example; they will be drawn towards him.
The activity from which a wise ruler is to abstain is the vexatious
multiplication of laws and edicts, which do harm rather
than good. But neither ruler nor philosopher is told to do
nothing; for benevolence, love, and the requital of good for
evil, to say nothing of other positive virtues, are most strictly
enjoined on all. Laò-tsé himself no doubt lived, and loved, a
retired contemplative life. This is the kind of existence which
he evidently considered the most perfect and the most godlike.
He counsels his followers to be wholly unambitious, and to
abstain from all active pursuit of political honor. Such counsel
might possibly be well adapted to the time in which he lived.
But none the less does he lay down rules for the guidance of
kings, statesmen, and warriors, in their several spheres. Nor
is the book wanting in pithy apothegms applicable to all, and
remarkable alike for the wisdom of their substance and the
neatness of their form. Whether, in short, we look to the simplicity
and grandeur of its speculative doctrine, or to the unimpeachable
excellence of its moral teaching, we shall find few
among the great productions of the human mind that evince,
from beginning to end, so lofty a spirit and so pure a strain.</p>

<p>The word <i>Veda</i> is explained by Sanskrit scholars as meaning
<i>knowing</i> or <i>knowledge</i>, and as being related to the Greek oἵδα.
The works comprised under this designation are manifold, and
appertain to widely different epochs. In the first place they fall
into two main classes, the <i>Sanhitâ</i> and the <i>Brâhmana</i>. The Sanhitâ
portion of the Veda consists of hymns or metrical compositions
addressed to the several deities worshiped by their
authors, and expressing religious sentiment; the Brâhmana portion,
of theological treatises in prose of an expository, ritualistic
and didactic character. Across this subdivision into two classes
there runs another of the whole Veda into four so-called
Vedas, the Rig-Veda, the Yajur-Veda, the Sâma-Veda, and the
Atharva-Veda. Each of these has its own Sanhitâs, and its own
Brâhmanas; but the Sanhitâ, or hymns, of the three other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426"> 426</span>
Vedas are not materially different from those of the Rig-Veda.
On the Rig-Veda they are all founded; this is the fundamental
Veda, or great Veda; and in knowing this one we should know
all. The other three, according to Max Müller, contain "chiefly
extracts from the Rig-Veda, together with sacrificial formulas,
charms, and incantations" (Chips, vol. i. p. 9). It must not
therefore be imagined that we have in these four Vedas four
different collections of hymns. They are rather four different
versions of the same collection, the Sâma-Veda, for instance,
containing but seventy-one verses which are wanting in the Rig-Veda
(S. V., p. xxviii), and being otherwise "little more than a
repetition of the Soma Mandala of the Rich" (Wilson, vol. i. p.
xxxvii), or of that book of the Rig-Veda which is devoted to the
god Soma. The Atharva-Veda-Sanhitâ is indeed to a certain
extent an exception; belonging to a later age, it has some
hymns altogether peculiar to itself, and its fifteenth book "has
something of the nature of a Brâhmana" (O. S. T., vol. i. p. 2).
It must be noted, moreover, that of the Yajur-Veda there are
two different versions, the Black and the White Yajur-Veda,
said to have descended from two rival schools. The hymns of
the first are termed the Taittiriya-Sanhitâ, those of the second
the Vâjasaneyi-Sanhitâ.</p>

<p>The origin of those four distinct, yet not different Vedas, is
thus explained. In certain sacrifices, formerly celebrated in
India, four classes of priests were required, each class being
destined for the performance of distinct offices. To such of
these classes was assigned one of the Vedas, which contained
the hymns required by that class. Thus the Sâma-Veda was
the prayer-book of the Udgâtri priests, or choristers, who chant
the hymns. The Yajur-Veda was the prayer-book of the Adhvaryu
priests, or attendant ministers, who prepare the ground,
slay the victims, and so forth. The Atharva-Veda was said to
be intended for the Brahman who was, according to one of the
Brâhmanas, the "physician of the sacrifice;" the general superintendent
who was to tell if any mistake had been committed
in it (A. B., 5. 5.—vol. ii. p. 376). For the fourth class, the Hotri
priests, or reciters of hymns, no special collection was made in
the form of a liturgy. They used the Rig-Veda, a collection of
the hymns in general without any special object, and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427"> 427</span>
supposed to know the sacred poetry without the help of a
prayer-book (A. S. L., pp. 175, 473, and Chips, vol. i. p. 9).</p>

<p>Originally preserved by scattered individuals (for the Mantra
part of the Vedas, [or their Sanhitâ] was composed in an age
when writing was not in use), the hymns were subsequently collected
and arranged in their present form: a task which Indian
tradition assigns to Vyâsa, the Arranger, but which was probably
the work of many different scholars, possibly during many
generations. The same tradition asserts that each Veda was
collected, under Vyâsa's superintendence, by a different editor;
and that the collections, transmitted from these primary compilers
to their disciples, were, in the course of transmission, rearranged
in various ways, until the number of Sanhitâs of each
Veda in circulation was very considerable. Each school had its
own version, but the differences are supposed by Wilson to have
concerned only the order, not the matter of the Sûktas.</p>

<p>The extreme antiquity of our extant Veda is guaranteed by
the amplest testimony. In the indexes compiled by native
scholars 500 or 600 years before Christ, "we find every hymn,
every verse, every word and syllable of the Veda accurately
counted" (Chips, vol. i. p. 11). Before this was done, not only
was the whole vast collection complete, but it was ancient; for
had it been a recent composition it would not have enjoyed the
preëminent sanctity which rendered it the object of this minute
attention. And not only is the Veda ancient, but it has been
shown that, from the variety of its component strata, it must
have been the growth of no small period of time, its earliest
elements being of an almost unfathomable antiquity. Max
Müller, who has elaborately treated this question, divides the
Vaidik age—the age during which the Veda was in process of
formation—into four great epochs. The most primitive hymns
of the Rig-Veda he attributes to what he terms <i>the Chhandas
period</i> (from Chhandas, or metre), the limits of which cannot be
fixed in the ascending direction, but which descends no later
than 1000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> And he thinks that "we cannot well assign a
date more recent than 1200 to 1500 before our era" (Ibid., vol. i.
p. 13) for the composition of these hymns. The ten books of
the Rig-Veda, however, comprise the poetry of two different
ages. Some of the hymns betray a more recent origin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428"> 428</span>
must be assigned to the second, or <i>Mantra period</i>. These comparatively
modern compositions belong to a time which may
have extended from about 1000 to about 800 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> After this we
enter on the <i>Brâhmana period</i>, in which the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ
not only existed, but had reached the stage of being misinterpreted,
its original sense having been forgotten. During this
period—which we may place from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 800 to 600—the national
thought took the form of prose, and the Brâhmanas were
written. Here the age of actually-inspired literature terminates,
and we arrive at the <i>Sûtra period</i>, which may have lasted till
200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Works of high authority, but not in the strict sense revealed
works, were produced during these four hundred years (A.
S. L., <i>passim</i>). An equal, or greater antiquity is usually claimed
by other Sanskritists for these several classes of sacred literature.
Wilson would place Manu (who belongs to the Sûtra
period) not lower than the fifth or sixth century; the Brâhmana
literature in the seventh or eighth; and would allow at least
four or five centuries before this for the composition and currency
of the hymns, thus reaching the date of 1200 or 1300 before
the Christian era (Wilson, vol. i. p. xlvii).</p>

<p>Haug, who believes that "a strict distinction between a
Chhandas and Mantra period is hardly admissible," and that
certain sacrificial formulas, considered by Max Müller to be
more recent, are in fact some centuries older than the finished
hymns ascribed by that scholar to the Chhandas age, carries
back the composition of both Sanhitâ and Brâhmana to a much
earlier date. "The bulk of the Brâhmanas" he assigns to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
1400-1200; and "the bulk of the Sanhitâs" to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 2000-1400;
while "the oldest hymns and sacrificial formulas may be a few
hundred years more ancient still," and thus "the very commencement
of Vedic literature" might be between <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 2400 and
2000 (A. B., vol. i. pp. 47, 48). While Benfey, considering that
the Prâtisâkhyas (a branch of the Sûtras) must have been composed
from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 800 to 600, observes that the text of the Sâma-Veda
must extend beyond this epoch (S. V., p. xxix).</p>

<p>Of the several Sanhitâs, that of the Rig-Veda (whose name
is derived from a word <i>rich</i>, praise) is usually considered the
most ancient, though Benfey expresses the opinion that the
text of the Sâma-Veda may possibly be borrowed from an older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429"> 429</span>
version of the Rig-Veda than before us (Ibid., p. xxix). Max
Müller, on the other hand, conceives the Sâma and Yajur-Vedas
to have been probably the production of the Brâhmana period
(A. S. L., p. 457). He even denies to any but the Rich the right
to be called Veda at all (Chips, vol. i. p. 9). Whatever claim,
or want of claim, they may possess to the honor, it is certain
that they have for more than 2,000 years invariably received it
at the hands of the Hindus themselves. So far from admitting
the preëminence of the Rich, the ancient Hindus, according to
one of their descendants, held the Sâma in the highest veneration
(Chhand. Up., introduction, p. 1). If a doubt can exist as
to the canonicity of any one of them, it can only apply to the
Atharva-Veda; for in certain texts we find mention made of
three Vedas only, the Atharva, from its comparatively late
origin, having apparently been long denied the privilege of
admission to an equal rank with its compeers.</p>

<p>Whatever their antiquity, the sanctity of these works in
Indian opinion is of the highest order. Never has the theory
of inspiration been pushed to such an extreme. The Veda was
the direct creation of Brahma; and the Rishis, or Sages, who
are the nominal authors of the hymns, did not compose them,
but simply "saw" them. Although, therefore, the name of
one of these seers is coupled with each hymn, it must not be
supposed that he did more than perceive the divine poem which
was revealed to his privileged vision. And the Veda is distinguished
as <i>Sruti</i>, Revelation, from the <i>Smriti</i>, Tradition, under
which term is included a great variety of works enjoying a high,
but not an independent, authority. They are to be accepted, in
theory at least, only when they agree with the Veda, and to be
set aside if they happen to differ from it; while no such thing
as a contradiction within the body of the Veda is for a moment
to be thought of as possible, apparent inconsistencies being
only due to our imperfect interpretations. The Sruti class comprises
only the Mantra of each Veda and its Brâhmanas; the
Smriti consists of the great national epics, namely the Râmâyana
and Mahâbhârata; the Mânava-Dharma-Sastra, or Menu;
the Purânas; the Sûtras, or aphorisms; and the so-called six
Vedângas, a term indicating six branches of study carried on
by the help of treatises on the pronunciation, grammar, metre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430"> 430</span>
explanation of words, astronomy, and ceremonial of the Veda.
How thoroughly the Veda was analyzed, how minutely every
word of it was investigated, is shown by the fact that these
Vedângas all have direct reference to it, and were intended to
assist in its comprehension. And in ancient times it was the
duty of Brahmans to be well acquainted both with the Sûktas
(hymns), and with their application to ritual. A Brahman,
indeed, who wanted to marry was not obliged to devote more
than twelve years to learning the Veda, but an unmarrying
Brahman might spend forty-eight years upon it (A. S. L., p. 503).</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span>—<i>The Sanhitâ.</i></h5>

<p>Passing now to a more detailed consideration of the Mantra
division, we find that the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ—the most comprehensive
specimen of this division—comprises more than a
thousand short poems, of which the vast majority are addressed
to one or more of the Indian gods. A few only, and those believed
to be of later origin, are of a different character. This
collection is divided in two ways; into ten Mandalas, or eight
Ashtakas, the two divisions being quite independent of one
another. Under each of these greater heads are several lesser
ones, which it is needless to enumerate. The deities to whom
the hymns are devoted are exceedingly various and numerous,
but as this is not an essay specially intended to elucidate the
Veda, but aiming only at a general comparison of this with
other sacred books, it would be going beyond our scope to
attempt a full account of their several names, attributes, and
honors. A few only of the more conspicuous gods need be
noticed.</p>

<p>Of these, Agni, as the one with whose praises the Rig-Veda
opens, and who, next to Indra, is the principal character in the
Vedic hymnology, claims our attention first. He is the god of
fire, or more literally, he is the fire itself, and a god at the
same time. His name is almost identical with the Latin <i>Ignis</i>.
He is frequently spoken of as generated by the rubbing of
sticks, for in this manner did the Rishis kindle the fire required
for their sacrifices. The sudden birth of the fiery element in
consequence of this process must have impressed them as pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431"> 431</span>foundly
mysterious. They allude to it under various images.
Thus, the upper stick is said to impregnate the lower, which
brings forth Agni. He is the bearer of human sacrifices to the
gods; a kind of telegraph from earth to heaven. Many are the
blessings asked of him. But let the Rishis speak for themselves.
Here is the first Sûkta of the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "I praise Agni, the household priest, the divine offerer of the
sacrifice, the inviter who keeps all treasures. 2. Agni, worthy of the
praises of the ancient Rishis, and also of ours, do thou bring hither the
gods. 3. By Agni, <i>the sacrificer</i> enjoys wealth, that grows from day to
day, confers renown, and surrounds him with heroes. 4. Agni, the
sacrifice which thou keepest from all sides uninvaded, approaches surely
the gods. 5. Agni, inviter, performer of gracious deeds, thou who art
truthful, and who shinest with various glories, come thou, O God,
with the gods. 6. The prosperity, which thou, O Agni, bestowest upon
the worshiper, will be in truth <i>a prosperity</i> to thee, O Angiras. 7. We
approach thee in our minds, O Agni, day after day, by night and day, to
offer thee our adoration. 8. Thee the radiant guardian of the meet
<i>reward</i> of the sacrifices, who is resplendent and increasing in his sacred
house. 9. Be thou, O Agni, accessible to us, as a father is to the son;
be near us for our welfare" (Roer, p. 1).</p>
</div>

<p>Even more important than Agni is Indra, the great national
god of the Hindus. He is above all things a combative god.
His strength is immense, and his worshipers implore him to
give them victory and power. He slays the demon Vrittra,
a myth symbolizing the dispersion of clouds by the sun.
Above all, he loves the juice of the Soma plant (<i>Asclepias
acida</i>), which is poured out to him abundantly in sacrifice, which
he consumes with avidity, and from which he derives renewed
force and energy. These two stanzas, taken from the Sâma-Veda,
express some of his attributes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thou, O Indra, art glorious, thou art victorious, thou art the lord
of strength; thou conquerest the strong enemies singly and alone, thou
unconquered refuge of men. To thee, living One, we pray; to thee
now the very wise, for treasures, as for our share; may thy blessing be
granted us" (S. V., ii. 6. 2. 12).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432"> 432</span></p>

<p>The following hymn brings into especial prominence the
more warlike functions of Indra, and may be regarded as a
prayer "in the time of war and tumults:"—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>8. "May Indra be the leader of these (our armies); may Brihaspati,
Largess, Sacrifice and Soma march in front; may the host of Maruts
precede the crushing, victorious armies of the gods. May the fierce host
of the vigorous Indra, of King Varuna, of the Adityas, and the Maruts
(go before us); the shout of the great-souled, conquering, world-shaking
gods, has ascended.... 10. Rouse, O opulent god, the weapons,
rouse the souls of our warriors, stimulate the power of the mighty men;
may shouts arise from the conquering chariots. 11. May Indra be ours
when the standards clash; may our arrows be victorious: may our
strong men gain the upper-hand; preserve us, O gods, in the fray. 12.
Bewildering the hearts of our enemies, O Apvâ (Apvâ is explained as a
disease or fear), take possession of their limbs and pass onward; come
near, burn them with fires in their hearts; may our enemies fall into
blind darkness" (O. S. T., vol. v. p. 110.—Rig-Veda, x. 103).</p>
</div>

<p>Indra's Soma-drinking propensities are not particularly alluded
to in these verses: elsewhere they form the ever-recurring
burden of the chants of which he is the hero. Thus, to take
but one specimen, which, by its resemblance to others, may
fitly stand for all, he is thus lauded:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "May the Somas delight thee! bestow grace, O hurler of lightning!
destroy him who hates the priest. 2. Thou who art praiseworthy,
drink our drink! thou art sprinkled with streams of honey! from
thee, O Indra, glory is derived.... 4. The Indus (the Somas)
stream into thee, like rivers, Indra! into the sea, and never overfill
thee" (S. V., i. 1. 1).</p>
</div>

<p>Indra is, in fact, the Zeus of Indian mythology; the thunderer,
the god of the sky, the all-powerful protector of men and destroyer
of the demons of darkness. His functions are easily
understood, but it is curious that the Soma, which is offered to
him in sacrifice, and which he drinks with all the avidity of a
confirmed toper, is itself celebrated as a god of very considerable
powers. Soma appears to be regarded as a sort of mediator
between the greatest gods and men, especially between man and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433"> 433</span>
Indra. He is repeatedly entreated to go to Indra, to flow around
him, and thus to conciliate and delight him. But Soma can
confer benefits independently. One poet implores him to stream
forth blessing "on the ox, the man, and the horse; and, O
king, blessings on plants" (S. V., ii. 1. 1. 1). In the hymns devoted
to him he is raised to an exalted station among the celestial
beings, while the sacrifice in which he is drunk by the
priests is the capital right in the Brahmanical liturgy (A. B.,
vol. i. p. 59). The most eminent virtues are inherent in this
divine beverage, when taken with all the ceremonies prescribed
by traditional law. The Soma juice has, in the opinion of Hindu
theologians, "the power of uniting the sacrificer on this earth
with the celestial King Soma," and making him "an associate
of the gods, and an inhabitant of the celestial world" (Ibid.,
vol. i. pp. 40, 80). Such was the excellence of this juice, that
none but Brahmans were permitted to imbibe it. Kings, at
their inaugural ceremonies, received a goblet which was nominally
Soma, but on account of their inferior caste they were in
fact put off with some kind of spirituous liquor which was supposed,
by a mystical transformation, to receive the properties
of that most holy divinity (Ibid., vol. ii. p. 522). Agreeably to
this theory of Soma's extensive powers, he is invoked in such
terms, for instance, as these:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7. "Place me, O purified god, in that everlasting and imperishable
world where there is eternal light and glory. O Indu (Soma),
flow for Indra. 8. Make me immortal in the world where king Vaivasvata
(Yama, the son of Vivasvat) lives, where is the innermost sphere
of the sky, where those great waters flow" (O. S. T., vol. v. p. 266.—Rig-Veda,
ix. 113).</p>
</div>

<p>Singular as it may seem that the juice of the Soma-plant
should be at once an object sacrificed on the altar to other gods
and a god himself, such a confusion of attributes will be less
surprising to those who are familiar with the Christian theory
of the Atonement, in which the same God is at once the person
who decrees the sacrifice, the person who accepts it, and
the victim. At least the double function of Soma is less perplexing
than the triple function of Christ.</p>

<p>Considerable among Vedic deities are the Maruts, or gods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434"> 434</span>
tempest. They are in intimate alliance with Indra, to whom
their violent nature is closely akin. Their attributes are simple.
A notion of them may perhaps be gained from these verses:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "What then now? When will you take (us) as a dear father takes
his son by both hands, O ye gods, for whom the sacred grass has been
trimmed? 2. Whither now? On what errand of yours are you going,
in heaven, not on earth? Where are your cows sporting? 3. Where
are your newest favors, O Maruts? Where the blessings? Where
all delights?... 6. Let not one sin after another, difficult to be
conquered, overcome us; may it depart together with lust. 7. Truly
they are furious and powerful; even to the desert the Rudriyas bring
rain that is never dried up. 8. The lightning lows like a cow, it follows
as a mother follows after her young, that the shower (of the Maruts)
may be let loose. 9. Even by day the Maruts create darkness with the
water-bearing cloud, when they drench the earth. 10. From the shout
of the Maruts over the whole space of the earth, men reeled forward.
11. Maruts on your strong-hoofed steeds go on easy roads after those
bright ones (the clouds) which are still locked up. 12. May your felloes
be strong, the chariots, and their horses; may your reins be well fashioned.
13. Speak out forever with thy voice to praise the Lord of
prayer, Agni, who is like a friend, the bright one. 14. Fashion a hymn
in thy mouth! Expand like a cloud! Sing a song of praise. 15. Worship
the host of the Maruts, the brisk, the praiseworthy, the singers.
May the strong ones stay here among us" (R. V. S., vol. i. p. 65.—Rig-Veda,
i. 38).</p>
</div>

<p>The most charming member of the Vedic pantheon, and the
one who seems to have called forth from the Rishis the deepest
poetical feeling, is Ushas (Ἔως), the Dawn. Her continual reappearance,
or birth, morning after morning, seems to have
filled them with delight and tenderness. The hymn now to be
quoted—too long to be extracted in full—gives expression to
the feelings with which they gazed upon this ever-recurring
mystery:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2. "The fair and bright Ushas, with her bright child (the Sun), has
arrived; to her the dark (night) has relinquished her abodes; kindred to
one another, immortal, alternating Day and Night go on changing color.
3. The same is the never-ending path of the two sisters, which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435"> 435</span>
travel, commanded by the gods. They strive not, they rest not, the
prolific Night and Dawn, concordant, though unlike. 4. The shining
Ushas, leader of joyful voices (or hymns) has been perceived; she has
opened for us the doors (of the sky); setting in motion all moving
things, she has revealed to us riches. Ushas has awakened all creatures....
6. (Arousing) one to seek royal power, another to follow after
fame, another for grand efforts, another to pursue as it were his particular
object,—Ushas awakes all creatures to consider their different
modes of life. 7. She, the daughter of the sky, has been beheld breaking
forth, youthful clad in shining attire: mistress of all earthly treasures.
Auspicious Ushas, shine here to-day. 8. Ushas follows the track
of the Dawns that are past, and is the first of the unnumbered Dawns
that are to come, breaking forth, arousing life and awaking every one
that was dead.... 10. How great is the interval that lies between
the Dawns which have arisen, and those which are yet to arise! Ushas
yearns longingly after the former Dawns, and gladly goes on shining
with the others (that are to come). 11. Those mortals are gone who
saw the earliest Ushas dawning; we shall gaze upon her now; and the
men are coming who are to behold her on future morns.... 13.
Perpetually in former days did the divine Ushas dawn; and now to-day
the magnificent goddess beams upon this world: undecaying, immortal,
she marches on by her own will" (O. S. T., vol. v. p. 188.—Rig-Veda,
i. 113).</p>
</div>

<p>Hardly a trace of a moral element is to be found in those
productions of the Rishis which have hitherto been quoted.
And such as these are is the general character of the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ.
It consists in petitions for purely material advantages,
coupled with unbounded celebrations of the power of the god
invoked, often under the coarsest anthropomorphic images.
But while it must be admitted that the sentiment expressed is
rarely of a high order, it must not be supposed that the old
Hindu gods are altogether destitute of ethical attributes.
Marked exceptions to the general tenor of the supplications
offered to them certainly occur. There are passages which
betray a decided consciousness of sin, a desire to be forgiven and
a conviction that certain kinds of conduct entail divine disapprobation,
while other kinds bring divine approbation. Thus,
in the hymns addressed to the Adityas, a class of gods generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436"> 436</span>
reckoned as twelve in number, and to Mitra and Varuna, two
of these Adityas, such feelings are plainly expressed (O. S. T.,
vol. v. p. 56 ff). Of these two, Mitra is sometimes explained as
the Sun, or the god of Day, Varuna as the god of Night.
Varuna—whose name corresponds to that of Ouranos—is a
very great and powerful divinity, who is endowed by his adorers
with the very highest attributes. He is said to have meted
out heaven and earth, and to dwell in all worlds as their
sovereign, embracing them within him (Ibid., vol. v. p. 61). He
is said to witness sin, and is entreated to have mercy on sinners.
One penitent poet implores Varuna to tell him for what
offense he seeks to kill his worshiper and friend, for all the
sages tell him that it is Varuna who is angry with him. And
he pleadingly contends that he was not an intentional culprit;
he has been seduced by "wine, anger, dice, or thoughtlessness."
Another begs the god that, in whatever way mortals may have
broken his laws, he will be gracious. A third admits that he,
who was Varuna's friend, has offended against him, but asks
that they who are guilty may not reap the fruits of their sin;
concluding with this amicable hint: "Do thou, a wise god,
grant protection to him who praises thee" (O. S. T., vol. v. pp.
66, 67). "The attributes and functions ascribed to Varuna,"
observes Dr. Muir, "impart to his character a moral elevation
and sanctity far surpassing that attributed to any other Vedic
deity" (Ibid., vol. v. p. 66). And while even in the earlier portion
of the Rig-Veda—from which the above expressions have
been collected by Dr. Muir—such qualities are ascribed to
Varuna, we shall find a still higher conception of his character
in a later work, the Atharva-Veda. Here is the description of
the Lord of Heaven from the mouth of the Indian Psalmist:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "The great lord of these worlds sees as if he were near. If a
man thinks he is walking by stealth, the gods know it all. 2. If a man
stands or walks or hides, if he goes to lie down or to get up, what two
people sitting together whisper, King Varuna knows it, he is there as
the third. 3. This earth, too, belongs to Varuna, the king, and this
wide sky with its ends far apart. The two seas (the sky and the ocean)
are Varuna's loins; he is also contained in this small drop of water.
4. He who should flee far beyond the sky, even he would not be rid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437"> 437</span>
Varuna, the king. His spies proceed from heaven towards this world;
with thousand eyes they overlook this earth. 5. King Varuna sees all
this that is between heaven and earth, and what is beyond. He has
counted the twinklings of the eyes of men. As a player throws the dice
he settles all things. 6. May all thy fatal nooses, which stand spread out
seven by seven and threefold, catch the man who tells a lie; may they
pass by him who tells the truth" (A. S. L.—Atharva-Veda, iv. 16).</p>
</div>

<p>A consciousness of the unity of Deity, under whatever form
he may be worshiped, adumbrated here and there in earlier
hymns, becomes very prominent in the later portions of the
Veda. From the most ancient times, possibly, occasional sages
may have attained the conception so familiar to the Hindu
thinkers of a later age, that a single mysterious essence of
divinity pervaded the universe. And in the tenth book of the
Rig-Veda, which is generally admitted to belong to a more
recent age than the other nine books, as also in the Atharva-Veda,
this essence is celebrated under various names; as Purusha,
as Brahma, as Prajapati (Lord), or Skambha (Support). The
hymns in which this consciousness appears are extremely mystical,
but a notice of the Veda, however slight, would be very
imperfect without a due recognition of their presence. They
form the speculative element partly in the midst of, partly succeeding
to, the simple, practical, naked presentation of the commonplace
daily wants and physical desires of the early Rishis.
Take the following texts from the first book of the Rig-Veda.
They give utterance to an incipient sentiment of divine unity.
The first celebrates a goddess Aditi: "Aditi is the sky, Aditi is
the air, Aditi is the mother and father and son. Aditi is all the
gods and the five classes of men. Aditi is whatever has been
born. Aditi is whatever shall be born" (O. S. T., vol. v. p. 354.—Rig-Veda,
i. 89. 10). More remarkable than this—for we may
suspect here a sectarian desire to glorify a favorite goddess—is
this assertion: "They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni;
and he is the celestial (well-winged) Garutmat. Sages name
variously that which is but one: they call it Agni, Yama, Mâtarisvan"
(O. S. T., vol. v. p. 353.—Rig-Veda, i. 164. 46). In
the tenth book of the Rig-Veda, the presence of the speculative
element in the theology of the Rishis,—their longing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438"> 438</span>
to find a universal Being whom they could adore,—is much
more marked. Thus do they express this sentiment:—"Wise
poets make the beautiful-winged, though he is one, manifold by
words" (Chips, vol. i. p. 29.—Rig-Veda, x. 114. 5). Or more elaborately
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "In the beginning there arose the golden Child—He was the one
born lord of all that is. He established the earth and this sky;—Who
is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice? 2. He who gives life,
He who gives strength; whose command all the bright gods revere;
whose shadow is immortality, whose shadow is death;—Who is the God
to whom we shall offer our sacrifice? 3. He who through his power is
the one King of the breathing and awakening world; He who governs all
man and beast; Who is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?
4. He whose greatness these snowy mountains, whose greatness the sea
proclaims, with the distant river—He whose these regions are, as it were
his two arms;—Who is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?
5. He through whom the sky is bright and the earth firm—He through
whom the heaven was established,—nay, the highest heaven;—He who
measured out the light in the air;—Who is the God to whom we shall
offer our sacrifice? 6. He to whom heaven and earth, standing firm by
His will, took up, trembling inwardly—He over whom the rising sun
shines forth;—Who is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?
7. Wherever the mighty water-clouds went, where they placed the seed
and lit the fire, thence arose He who is the sole life of the bright gods;—Who
is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice? 8. He who by
his might looked even over the water-clouds, the clouds which gave
strength and lit the sacrifice; He who alone is God above all gods;—Who
is the God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice? 9. May He not destroy
us—He the creator of the earth; or He, the righteous, who created the
heaven; He also created the bright and mighty waters;—Who is the
God to whom we shall offer our sacrifice?" (Chips, vol. i. p. 29, or A.
S. L., p. 569.—Rig-Veda, x. 121).</p>
</div>

<p>The same book contains a very important hymn, entitled the
Purusha Sûkta. In it we find ourselves transported from the
transparent elemental worship of the ancient Aryas into the
misty region of Brahmanical subtleties. Purusha appears to be
conceived as the universal essence of the world, all existences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439"> 439</span>
being but one-quarter of him. The theory of sacrifice occupies,
as in the later Indian literature generally, a prominent position.
Purusha's sacrifice involved the momentous consequences of the
creation of the several Vedas and of living creatures. The
four castes sprang from different parts of his person, the parts
corresponding to their relative dignity. The purpose of this
portion is obvious, namely, to give greater sanctity to the system
of caste, a system to which the earlier hymn makes no
allusion, and which we may suppose to have grown up subsequently
to the era of their composition. Tedious as it is, the
Purusha Sûkta is too weighty to be quite passed over.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "Purusha has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.
On every side enveloping the earth, he overpassed (it) by a space of ten
fingers. 2. Purusha himself is this whole (universe), whatever has been
and whatever shall be. He is also the lord of immortality, since (or
when) by food he expands. 3. Such is his greatness, and Purusha is
superior to this. All existences are a quarter of him; and three-fourths
of him are that which is immortal in the sky. 4. With three-quarters
Purusha mounted upwards. A quarter of him was again produced
here. He was then diffused everywhere over things which eat and
things which do not eat. 5. From him was born Virāj, and from
Virāj, Purusha. When born, he extended beyond the earth, both behind
and before. 6. When the gods performed a sacrifice with Purusha
as the oblation, the spring was its butter, the summer its fuel, and the
autumn its (accompanying) offering. 7. This victim, Purusha, born in
the beginning, they immolated on the sacrificial grass. With him the
gods, the Sādhyas, and the Rishis sacrificed. 9. From that universal
sacrifice sprang the rich and sāman verses, the metres and the yajush.
10. From it sprang horses, and all animals with two rows of teeth; kine
sprang from it; from it goats and sheep. 11. When (the gods) divided
Purusha, into how many parts did they cut him up? what was his
mouth? what arms (had he)? what (two objects) are said (to have been)
his thighs and feet? 12. The Brahman was his mouth; the Râjanya
was made his arms; the being (called) the Vaisya, he was his thighs; the
Sûdra sprang from his feet. 13. The moon sprang from his soul
(manas), the sun from his eye, Indra and Agni from his mouth, and
Vāyu from his breath. 14. From his navel arose the air, from his head
the sky, from his feet the earth, from his ear the (four) quarters; in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440"> 440</span>
manner (the gods) formed the worlds. 15. When the gods, performing
sacrifice, bound Purusha as a victim, there were seven sticks (stuck up)
for it (around the fire), and thrice seven pieces of fuel were made. 16.
With sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice. These were the earliest
rites. These great powers have sought the sky, where are the former
Sādhyas, gods" (O. S. T., vol. i. p. 9.—Rig-Veda, x. 90).</p>
</div>

<p>The wide interval which separates theological theories of
this kind from the primitive hymns to the old polytheistic
gods, is also marked by a tendency to personify abstract intellectual
conceptions, and to confer exalted attributes upon them.
Skambha, or Support, mentioned above; Kâla, Time, celebrated
in the Atharva-Veda; Speech, endowed with personal powers in
the tenth book of the Rig-Veda; Wisdom, to whom prayer is
offered in the Atharva-Veda, are instances of this generalizing
tendency. As a specimen, the hymn to Wisdom may be taken,
and readers may console themselves with the reflection that it
is our last quotation from the Mantra part of the Veda:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "Come to us, wisdom, the first, with cows and horses; (come)
thou with the rays of the sun; thou art to us an object of worship. 2.
To (obtain) the succor of the gods, I invoke wisdom the first, full of
prayer, inspired by prayer, praised by rishis, imbibed by Brahmachārins.
3. We introduce within me that wisdom which Ribhus know,
that wisdom which divine beings (asurāh) know, that excellent wisdom
which rishis know. 4. Make me, O Agni, wise to-day with that wisdom
which the wise rishis—the makers of things existing—know. 5. We
introduce wisdom in the evening, wisdom in the morning, wisdom at
noon, wisdom with the rays of the sun, and with speech" (O. S. T.,
vol. i. p. 255 note.—Atharva-Veda, vi. 108).</p>
</div>

<p>Interesting as the Mantra of the Vedas is from the fact of
its being the oldest Bible of the Aryan race, it is impossible
for modern readers to feel much enthusiasm for its contents.
The patient labor of these scholars who have engaged in translations
of some parts of it for the benefit of European readers
is highly commendable, but it is probable that few who have
read any considerable number of these hymns will be desirous
of a further acquaintance with them, unless for the purpose of
some special researches. Indeed, it may be said that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441"> 441</span>
devoted industry of Benfey, Muir, Max Müller, and others, has
placed more than a sufficient number of them within reach of
the general public to enable us all to judge of their literary
value and their religious teaching. With regard to the former, it
would be difficult to concede to them anything but a very
modest place. In beauty of style, expression, or ideas, they
appear to me to be almost totally deficient. Assuming, as we
are entitled to do, that all the best specimens have been already
culled by scholars eager to find something attractive in the
Veda, it must be confessed that the general run of the hymns
is singularly monotonous, and their language by no means
conspicuous for poetical coloring. No doubt, poetry always loses
in translation; but Isaiah and Homer are still beautiful in a
German or English dress; the Sûktas of the Rig-Veda are not.
A few exceptions no doubt occur, as in the stanzas to Ushas, or
Dawn, quoted above, but the ordinary level is not a high one.</p>

<p>Although, however, the literary merit of the Veda cannot be
ranked high, its value to the religious history of humanity at
large, and of our race in particular, can hardly be overrated.
To the comparative mythologist, above all, it possesses illimitable
interest, from the new light it sheds upon the origin and
significance of many of those world-wide tales which, in their
metamorphosed Hellenic shape, could not be effectually brought
under the process of dissection by which their primitive elements
have now been laid bare. Mythology is beyond the
province of this work, and therefore I purposely refrain from
entering upon any explanation of the physical meaning of the
old Aryan gods, or of the stories in which they figure.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> All
that I have to do with here is the grade attained in the development
of religious feeling among those who worshiped them.
And this, it is plain, was at first a very elementary one. The
more striking phenomena of nature—the sun, the moon, the
sky, the storms, the dawn, the fire—at first attracted their
attention, and absorbed their adoration. To these personal
beings, as they seemed to the awe-struck Rishis, petitions of
the rudest type were confidently addressed. Very little allusion,
if any, was made to the necessities of the moral nature; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442"> 442</span>
craving for spiritual knowledge was scarcely felt; but great
stress was laid on temporal prosperity. Boons of the most
material kind were looked for at the hands of the gods. Plenty
of offspring, plenty of physical strength, plenty of property,
especially in cattle, and victory over enemies; such are the requests
most commonly poured into the ears of Indra, or Agni,
or the Maruts. These gods are regarded as the sympathizing
friends of men, and if they should fail to do what may reasonably
be expected of a god, are almost upbraided for their negligence.
The conception of their power is a high one, though
that of their moral nature is still rudimentary. Their greatness
and their glory, their victories, their splendor, are described in
vigorous and high-sounding phrases. The changes are rung upon
their peculiar attributes or their famous exploits. Each god in
his turn is a great god; but all are separate individuals; there
appears in the crude Aryan mind to be as yet no dawning of
the perplexing questions on the unity of the Divine which
troubled its later development. For as it progresses, the Hindu
religion gradually changes. External calm, succeeding the wars
of the first settlers, promotes internal activity. The great problem
of the Universe is no longer solved, five or six centuries
after the older Rishis had passed away, in the simple fashion
which satisfied their curiosity. Multiplicity is now resolved into
unity; mystical abstractions take the place of the elementary
powers of nature. Speech is a goddess; the Vedas themselves—as
in the Purusha hymn—acquire a quasi-divinity; the Brahmachârin,
or student of theology, is endowed with supernatural
attributes, due to the sacred character of his pursuits. Sacrifice,
fixed and regulated down to the smallest minutiæ, has a
peculiar efficacy, and becomes something of far deeper meaning
than a merely acceptable present to the gods. Every posture,
every word, every tone acquires importance. There are charms,
there are curses, there are incantations for good and evil purposes,
for the acquisition of wealth or the destruction of an
enemy. It is by its collection of such magical formulæ that
the Atharva-Veda is distinguished from its three predecessors.
It forms the last stone laid upon the edifice of the genuine
Veda, an edifice built up by the labor of many centuries, and
including the whole of that original revelation to which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443"> 443</span>
centuries that succeeded it bowed down in reverence and in
faith.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>The Brâhmanas.</i></h5>

<p>Attached to this edifice as an outgrowth rather than an integral
part, the treatises known as Brâhmanas took their place
as appendages of the Sanhitâ. Although they are reckoned by
the Hindus as belonging to the Sruti, although their nominal
rank is thus not inferior to that of the true Veda, yet it must
have taken them many generations to acquire a position of
honor to which nothing but tradition could possibly entitle
them. For any gleams of poetical inspiration, of imaginative
religious feeling, of naturalness or simple earnestness that had
shone athwart the minds of devout authors in preceding ages,
had apparently passed away when the Brâhmanas were composed.
They are the elaborate disquisitions of scholars, not the
outpourings of men of feeling. Religion was cut and dried
when they were written; every part of it has become a matter
of definition, of theory, of classification. If in the Vedic hymns
we are placed before a stage where religious faith is a living
body, whose movements, perhaps uncouth, are still energetic
and genuine, the Brâmhanas, on the other hand, take us into
the dissecting-room, where the constituent elements of its
corpse are exposed to our observation. Not indeed that a true
or deep faith had ceased in the Brâhmana period; such an
assertion would no doubt be extravagant; but the Brâhmanas
themselves are the products of minds more given to analysis
than to sentiment, and of an age in which the predominant
tendency, at least among cultivated Brahmans, was not so much
to feel religion as to think about it. It is so everywhere. The
Hebrew Bible, once fixed and completed, gives rise to the
Mishnah. The Apostles and Fathers of the Christian Church are
followed by a race of schoolmen. The simple Sûtras of Buddhism,
replete with plain, world-wide lessons of moral truth,
give place to the abstruse developments of incomprehensible
theology. Thus the Brâhmanas mark the epoch when the Veda
had finally ceased to grow, and its every word and letter had
become the object of an unquestioning adoration as the immediate
emanation of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444"> 444</span></p>

<p>But among a people so subtle and so inquisitive in all matters
of religious belief as the Hindus, opinion could not rest
unmoved upon the original foundation. Their minds did not,
like those of the Jews, stop short for ever in their intellectual
progression, chained to the unshakeable rock of a god-given
Revelation. Ever active, ever attracted to the enigmas of life,
the Brahmans pushed their speculations into new regions of
thought, pondered upon new problems, and invented new solutions.
Not that we are to expect to find in the literature of
this period any valuable discoveries or any very striking philosophy.
The true philosophical systems came later. But still
we do find a restless spirit of inquiry, ever prompting fresh
efforts to conceive the significance of the gods or to penetrate
the mysteries of nature, though the questions discussed are
often trifling, and the results arrived at frivolous.</p>

<p>Every Veda has, as already stated, its own Brâhmana or
Brâhmanas. Thus, two of these treatises appertain to the Rig-Veda;
three to the Sâma-Veda, one to the Black and one to
the White Yajur-Veda, and one to the Atharva-Veda (O. S. T.,
vol. i. p. 5). Appended to the Brâhmanas, and forming, according
to Dr. Muir, their "most recent portions," are the Âranyakas
and Upanishads, a kind of supplementary works devoted to
the elucidation of the highest points of theology. The Brâhmanas
present an example of Ritualism in all its glory. They
fix the exact nature of every part of every ceremony; describe
minutely the mode in which each sacrifice is to be offered;
mention the Mantras to be recited on each occasion; declare
the benefits to be expected from the several rites, and explain
the reasons—drawn from the history of the gods—why they
are all to be performed in this particular way and order, and
in no other. They are in fact liturgies, accompanied by exposition.
Hence they are totally unfit for quotation in a general
work, for they would be incomprehensible without an accompanying
essay on the Vedic sacrifices, entering into details
which would interest none but professional students of the
subject.</p>

<p>Thus, the Aitareya Brâhmana occupies itself entirely with
the duties of the Hotri priests; for the recitation of the Rig-Veda,
to which this Brâhmana belonged, was their province.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445"> 445</span>
Occasionally, however, the Brâhmanas, Upanishads, and Âranyakas
are enlivened by the introduction of apologues, intended
to illustrate the point of theological dogma to which the author
is addressing himself. Some of these apologues are curious,
though the style in which they are related is generally so prolix
as to preclude extraction. A notion of them may be gathered
from condensed statements. Thus, in the Brihad Âranyaka
Upanishad a story is told of a dispute among the vital organs
as to which of them was "best founded," <i>i. e.</i>, most essential
to life. To obtain the decision of this controversy they repaired
to Brahma, who said, "He amongst you is best founded by
whose departure the body is found to suffer most." Hereupon
Speech departed, and returning after a year's absence, inquired
how the others had lived without it. "They said, 'As dumb
people who do not speak by speech, breathing by the vital breath,
seeing by the eye, hearing by the ear, thinking by the mind,
and begetting children, so have we lived.'" The eye, the ear,
the mind, the organ of generation, each departed for a year,
and, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, with similar results; blindness, deafness,
idiocy, impotence, were all compatible with life. Lastly, "the
vital breath being about to depart, as a great, noble horse from
the Sindhu country raises its hoofs, so it shook these vital
organs from their places. They said, 'Do not depart, O Venerable.
We cannot live without thee.' 'If I am such, then offer
sacrifice to me.' (They answered)—'Be it so.'" All the other
organs hereupon admitted that their own existence depended on
that of the vital breath (B. A. U., ch. vi. p. 259).</p>

<p>Several narratives in various Brâhmanas point to the fact
that theological knowledge was not in these early days confined
to the single caste by which it was afterwards monopolized, for
they speak of well-read kings by whom Brahmans were instructed.
In the Chândogya Upanishad, for example, five members
of the Brahmanical caste engaged in a debate upon the
question "Which is our soul, and which is Brahma?" Unable
to satisfy themselves, they repaired, accompanied by another
theologian who had been unable to answer them, to a monarch
named Asvapati, and declining his proffered gifts, requested him
to impart to them the knowledge he possessed of the Universal
Soul. He accordingly asked each of them in turn which soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446"> 446</span>
he adored. The first replied that he adored the heaven; the
second, the sun; the third, the winds; the fourth, the sky; the
fifth, water; the sixth, the earth. To each of them in turn the
king admitted that it was indeed a partial manifestation of the
Universal Soul which he worshiped, and that its adoration
would confer some advantages. But, he finally added, "You
consume food, knowing the Universal Soul to be many; but he
who adoreth that Universal Soul which pervadeth the heaven
and the earth, and is the principal object indicated by (the pronoun)
<i>I</i>, consumeth food everywhere and in all regions, in every
form and in every faculty." Of that all-pervading Soul the several
phenomena of the visible Universe worshiped by the Brahmans
in their ignorance are but parts (Chhand. Up., ch. v. section
11-18, p. 92-97). Other Brâhmanas tell similar stories of the
occasional preëminence of the Kshattriya caste in the rivalry of
learning. Thus, the Satapatha Brâhmana, the Brihad Âranyaka
Upanishad, and the Kaushîtaki Brâhmana Upanishad, all refer
to a certain king Ajâtasatru, who proved himself superior in
theological disputation to a Brahman named Bālāki, "renowned
as a man well-read in the Veda." Let us take the version of
the last-named Upanishad. Bālāki proposed to "declare divine
knowledge" to the king, who offered to give him a thousand
cows for his tuition. But after he had propounded his views on
the Deity, and had been put to shame by the king's answers,
the latter said, "Thou hast vainly proposed to me; let me
teach thee divine knowledge. He, son of Balaka, who is the
maker of these souls, whose work that is,—he is the object of
knowledge." Convinced of his ignorance, Bālāki proposed to
become the king's pupil. "The king replied, 'I regard it as an
inversion of the proper rule that a Kshattriya should initiate a
Brahman. But come, I will instruct thee'" (O. S. T., vol. i. p.
431).</p>

<p>Both these stories illustrate the striving towards conceptions
of the unity of the divine essence which is characteristic of this
speculative age. The next, from the Satapatha Brâhmana, has
reference to another important point,—the future of the soul.
A young Brahman, called Svetaketu, came to a monarch who
inquired whether he had received a suitable education from his
father. The youth replied that he had. Hereupon the king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447"> 447</span>
proceeded to put him through an examination, in which he completely
broke down. One of the questions was this:—"Dost thou
know the means of attaining the path which leads to the gods,
or that which leads to the Pitris (Ancestors (<i>patres</i>)); by what
act the one or the other is gained?" In other words did he
know the way to heaven? The student did not. Vexed at his
failure, the young man hastened to his father, reproached him
with having declared that he was instructed, and complained
that the Râjanya had asked him five questions, of which he
knew not even one. Gautama inquired what they were, and on
hearing them, assured his son that he had taught him all he
himself knew. "But come, let us proceed thither, and become
his pupils." Receiving his guest with due respect, the king
offered Gautama a boon. Gautama begged for an explanation of
the five questions. "That," said the king, "is one of the divine
boons; ask one of those that are human." But Gautama protested
that he had wealth enough of all kinds, and added, "Be
not illiberal towards us in respect to that which is immense,
infinite, boundless." The king accordingly accepted them as his
pupils, saying, "Do not attach any blame to me, as your ancestors
(did not). This knowledge has never heretofore dwelt in
any Brahman; but I shall declare it to thee. For who should
refuse thee when thou so speakest?" (O. S. T., vol. i. p. 434.)</p>

<p>Unhistorical as they probably are in their details, these traditions
are curious both as illustrating the predominant inclination
to speculative inquiries, and the fact that in those inquiries
the priestly caste was sometimes outshone by their more secular
rivals. The following quotation bears upon another doctrine,
the transcendent merit of patience under trials, even of the
severest kind. Manu, the typical ancestor of mankind, is represented
as resigning his most precious possessions to enable
impious priests to perform a sacrifice:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Manu had a bull. Into it an Asura-slaying, enemy-slaying voice
had entered. In consequence of this (bull's) snorting and bellowing,
Asuras and Râkshasas (these are species of demons) were continually
destroyed. Then the Asuras said, 'This bull, alas! does us mischief;
how shall we overcome him?' Now there were two priests of the
Asuras called Kilâta and Akuli. They said, 'Manu is a devout be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448"> 448</span>liever:
let us make trial of him.' They went and said to him, 'Let us
sacrifice for thee.' 'With what victim?' he asked. 'With this bull,'
they replied. 'Be it so,' he answered. When it had been slaughtered,
the voice departed out of it, and entered into Manu's wife Mânavî.
Wherever they hear her speaking, the Asuras and Râkshasas continue
to be destroyed in consequence of her voice. The Asuras said, 'She
does us yet more mischief; for the human voice speaks more.' Kilâta
and Akuli said, 'Manu is a devout believer: let us make trial of him.'
They came and said to him, 'Manu, let us sacrifice for thee.' 'With
what victim?' he asked. 'With this (thy) wife,' they replied. 'Be it
so,' he answered" (O. S. T., vol. i. p. 188).</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, though not often, the Brâhmanas contain references
to moral conduct. A very theological definition of Duty
is given in the Chândogya Upanishad, where it is stated,
"Threefold is the division of Duty. Sacrifice, study, and charity
constitute the first; penance is the second; and residence
by a Brahmachârin (a student of theology) exclusively in the
house of a tutor is the third. All those [who attend to these
duties] attain virtuous regions; the believer in Brahma alone
attains to immortality" (A. B., vii. 2. 10). In another Brâhmana
it is asserted that "the marriage of Faith and Truth is a
most happy one. For by Faith and Truth joined they conquer
the celestial world" (Chhand. Up., ch. ii. sec. 23). And the
the story of Sunahsepa, which contains an emphatic repudiation
of human sacrifice, has a moral bearing. As a rule, however,
the Brâhmanas do not concern themselves with ethical
questions. The rules of sacrifice, and the doctrines of a complicated
theology, are their main business; and the topics they
are thus led to debate in elaborate detail must frequently impress
the European reader as not only uninteresting, but unmeaning.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section IV.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Tripitaka.</span><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></h4>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449"> 449</span></p>

<p>When the master-mind who, by oral and personal instruction,
has led his disciples to the knowledge of new and invaluable
truths passes away—when the lips that taught them are
closed forever, and the intellect that solved the problems of
human life is at rest, when the soul that met the spiritual
cravings of their souls is no more near them—a necessity at
once arises for the collection of the sayings, the apologues, or
the parables which can now be heard no more, and which only
live in the memories of those who heard them. The precious
possession must not be lost. The light must not be suffered to
die out. Either the words of the Departed One must be transmitted
orally from disciple to disciple, from generation to generation
(as happens in countries where writing is uncommon or
unknown), or they must be rendered imperishable by being
once for all recorded in books.</p>

<p>Such was the course of events upon the death of Gautama
Buddha. Tradition tells us that immediately after that great
Teacher had entered into Nirvâna, his disciples assembled in
council to collect his λόγια, and to fix the Canons of the Faith.
This Canon consisted of three portions, and is therefore called
the <i>Tripitaka</i>, or Three Baskets. Of these baskets, his disciple
Upali was appointed to recall to memory, and edit, the
one termed <i>Vinaya</i>, or the Buddha's instructions on discipline;
Ananda (the intimate friend of Gautama), the Sûtras, or practical
teachings; and Kâsyapa, the Abhidharma, or metaphysical
lectures. Into these three classes the Buddhist Canon
remains still divided. But the text, as thus established, did not
escape the necessity of further revision. One hundred and ten
years after Sakyamuni's decease, certain monks brought considerable
scandal on the Church by disregarding his precepts. To
meet the difficulty, a council was held under the Buddhist king
Asoka, the orthodox faith was determined, and a new edition of
the Canonical Works compiled by seven hundred "accomplished
priests." Divisions and heresies, however, could not be pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450"> 450</span>vented.
In Kanishka's reign, four hundred years after Buddha,
the Church was split up into eighteen sects, and a third council
had to issue a third Revision of the Sacred Texts.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>All this is not to be taken as literally true. Especially is it
impossible to accept the story that a Text of the Buddha's precepts
and lectures was formed immediately after his death. It
is probable that not even the earliest parts of the Tripitaka were
committed to writing till long after that event, and it is quite
certain that its later elements could not have been added till
some centuries after it. Nevertheless, there may be, and indeed
it is almost beyond doubt that there are, some works in this
Canon which were already current as the Word of Buddha in
the time of Asoka, who reigned in the third century before
Christ. In an inscription quoted by Burnouf, and indisputably
emanating from that monarch, it is stated that the law embraces
the following topics:—"The limits marked by the Vinaya, the
supernatural faculties of the Ariyas, the dangers of the future,
the stanzas of the hermit, the Sûtra of the hermit, the speculation
of Upatisa (Sariputtra) only, the instruction of Laghula
(Rahula), rejecting false doctrines. This," adds the proclamation,
"is what has been said by the blessed Buddha" (Lotus, p.
725). In this enumeration we recognize, as Burnouf has observed,
the classes Vinaya and Sûtra, which still form two out of the
three baskets, and we find also that certain texts were accepted
by the Church as containing the genuine teaching of the Buddha.
We must suppose, therefore, that at the epoch of the Council
held under Asoka in <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 246, there were already many unquestioned
works in circulation. Nor is there any reason to doubt
that some of these have descended to our times. Burnouf
divides the Sûtras (in the more general sense of instructions or
sermons) into two kinds: simple, and developed Sûtras, of which
the simple ones bear marks of antiquity and of fairly representing
primitive Buddhism, while the developed Sûtras contain the
fanciful speculations of a later age.</p>

<p>Two most fortunate discoveries, the one made by Mr. Hodgson
in Nepaul, the other by Csoma Kőrösi in Thibet, have
placed the vast collection forming the Canon of Buddhism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451"> 451</span>
within the reach of European scholars. Brian Houghton Hodgson
was the British Resident in Nepaul in the early part of the
present century, and he there succeeded in obtaining a large
number of volumes in Sanskrit which he presented to the
Asiatic Societies of London and Paris. To the latter he presented
first twenty-four works, and subsequently sixty-four
MSS., being copies of works he had sent to the Asiatic Society
in London. These books happily fell into the hands of one of
the greatest of Sanskrit scholars, Eugène Burnouf, who, in his
"History of Indian Buddhism," translated a sufficient number
of them to serve as specimens. About the same time a zealous
Hungarian, Csoma Kőrös, undertook an adventurous journey
into the heart of Asia, with a view of discovering the original
stock of the Hungarian race. Failing in this object, he achieved
another of greater value, that of unearthing the whole of the
sacred books known in Thibet under the name of the <i>Kah-gyur</i>,
or <i>Kan-gyur</i> (properly b<i>kah</i>-h<i>gyur</i>), which is the Thibetan translation,
in one hundred volumes, of the very works of which
Hodgson in Nepaul had discovered the Sanskrit originals. Such
is the nature of our guarantees for the authenticity of the text.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span>—<i>The Vinaya-Pitaka.</i></h5>

<p>Let us proceed to consider in detail the division which stands
first in the Buddhist classification, the Vinaya-Pitaka, or basketful
of works on Discipline. These, according to Burnouf, are
of very different ages, some being, from the details they furnish
with reference to Sakyamuni, his institutions and his surroundings,
of very ancient date, and others, which relate events that
did not occur till two hundred years or more after his death,
belonging to a more recent period. One of the most instructive
of the legends which form the staple of the works on Discipline,
is that of Pûrna. Only a brief extract of it can be attempted
here.</p>

<p>Bhagavat (that is, the Lord, or Buddha) was at Srâvasti, in
the garden of Anâtha-pindika. (Anâtha-pindika was a householder
who had embraced the religion of the Buddha, and in
whose garden he was accustomed to preach.) There resided at
this time in the town of Surparaka a very wealthy house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452"> 452</span>holder,
named Bhava. This Bhava had three sons by his legitimate
wife, who were christened respectively Bhavila, Bhavatrata,
and Bhavanandin. After some years he fell into an illness
which led to his using language of extraordinary violence.
His wife with her three sons deserted him in consequence, but
a young female slave, reflecting that he had immense wealth,
and that it would not be suitable for her to desert him,
remained in the house and nursed him throughout his malady.
Seeing that he owed her his life, Bhava on his recovery told her
that he would give her a reward. The young woman begged
that if satisfied she might be admitted to her master's bed.
Bhava endeavored to get off, promising a handsome sum of
money and her liberty instead, but the girl was determined, and
obtained her wish. The result was that "after eight or nine
months" she gave birth to a beautiful boy, to whom the name
of Pûrna (the Accomplished) was given. The infant Pûrna was
confided to eight nurses, and subsequently received a first-rate
education. In due time, the three elder sons were married by
their father's desire, but the father, seeing them absorbed in
mere uxoriousness, reproved their indolence, telling them that
he had not been married until he had amassed a lac (100,000) of
Suvarna (representing about twenty-eight shillings). Struck by
this reproof, the three sons went to sea on a mercantile expedition,
and returned after having each made a lac of Suvarnas.
But Pûrna, who had remained at home to manage the shop,
was found to have gained an equal sum in the same time.
Bhava, perceiving Pûrna's talents, impressed on his sons the
importance of union, and the duty of disregarding what was
said by their wives, women being the destroyers of family
peace. He illustrated his remarks by a striking expedient.
Having desired his sons to bring some wood, and to kindle it,
he then ordered them all to withdraw the brands. This being
done, the fire went out, and the moral was at once understood
by the four young men. United the fuel burns; and thus the
union of brothers makes their strength. Bhavila in particular
was warned by his father never to abandon Pûrna. In course
of time Bhava died, and the three legitimate sons undertook
another voyage. During their absence, the wives of the two
younger sons fancied themselves ill-treated by Pûrna, who, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453"> 453</span>
the midst of his business in the shop, did not supply their
maids fast enough with all they sent for. On the return of their
husbands these two complained to them that were treated as
happens to those in whose family the son of a slave exercises
the command. The two brothers merely reflected that women
sowed divisions in families. Unhappily, however, some trifling
incidents, in which Bhavila's child appeared to have been
treated by Pûrna with undue partiality, gave the sister-in-law a
more plausible pretext for their complaints. Such was the
effect of their jealousy, that the younger brothers determined to
demand a division of the property, in which Pûrna (as a slave)
was to form one of the lots. Bhavila, as eldest brother, had
first choice, and remembering his father's advice, chose Pûrna.
One of the other brothers took the house and land, and ejected
Bhavila's wife; the other took the shop and the property in
foreign parts, and ejected Pûrna. Bhavila, his wife, and Pûrna,
retired penniless to the house of a relative. The wife in distress
sent out Pûrna with nothing but a brass coin, which had been
attached to her dress, to buy provisions. Pûrna met a man who
had picked up some stranded sandal-wood on the sea-shore, and
buying it of him (on credit) for five hundred Kârshâpanas, sold
a portion of it again for one thousand. With this sum he first
paid the man who had sold the wood, and then obtained provisions
for the household. He had still in his possession some
pieces of the sandal-wood, which was of a very valuable species
called Gosirsha. Shortly after this, the king fell ill, and his
doctors having prescribed an unguent of this very wood, it was
found that no one but Pûrna had any in his possession. Pûrna
sold a piece of it to the Government at one thousand Kârshâpanas,
and the king recovered. Hereupon he reflected that he
was but a poor sort of king who had no Gosirsha sandal-wood
in his establishment, and sent for Pûrna. Pûrna, guessing his
object, approached him with one piece in his hand, and three
in his robe. The king, after ascertaining that the price of the
one piece would be a lac of Suvarnas, inquired if there was
more. Pûrna then showed him the three other pieces, and the
king would have given him four lacs of Suvarnas. The wily
merchant, however, offered to present him with one piece, and
when the grateful monarch offered him a boon, requested that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454"> 454</span>
he might henceforth be protected against all insults, which was
at once accorded.</p>

<p>About this time five hundred merchants arrived at Surparaka
with a cargo of goods. The Merchants' Company passed a resolution
that none of them should act independently of the rest
in buying any of these goods; in short, that there should be no
competition. Any one dealing with the merchants alone was
to pay a fine. Pûrna, however, at once went to the vessel and
bought the whole cargo at the price demanded, eighteen lacs
of Suvarnas, paying the three lacs he had received as security.
The Merchants' Company, finding themselves anticipated, seized
Pûrna and exposed him to the sun to force him to pay the
fine. No sooner was the king informed of this than he sent
for the Merchants' Company to learn the cause of their proceedings.
They told him; but being obliged to confess that
they had never informed Pûrna or his brother of the resolution
passed, they had to release him with shame. Fortune still
favored him. Soon after this, the king happened to require the
very articles which Pûrna had purchased, and desired the
Merchants' Company to purchase them. Pûrna hereupon sold
them at double the price he had paid. His next step was to
undertake a sea-voyage for commercial purposes, and the first
having been successful, it was followed by five others, all
equally so. His seventh was undertaken at the instance of
some Buddhist merchants from Srâvasti, where Gautama was
teaching. During the voyage he was profoundly impressed
with their religious demeanor. "These merchants, at night
and at dawn, read aloud the hymns, the prayers which lead to
the other shore, the texts which disclose the truth, the verses
of the Sthaviras, those relating to the several sciences, and
those of the hermits, as well as the Sûtras containing sections
about temporal interests. Pûrna, who heard them, said to
them, 'Gentlemen, what is that fine poetry which you sing?'
'It is not poetry, O prince of merchants; it is the very words
of the Buddha.' Pûrna, who had never till now heard this
name of Buddha mentioned, and who felt his hair stand up all
over his body, inquired with deep respect, 'Gentlemen, who is
he whom you call Buddha?' The merchants replied, 'The
Sramana Gautama, descended from the Sakya family, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455"> 455</span>
having shaven his hair and beard, having put on garments of
yellow hue, left his house with perfect faith to enter upon a
religious life, and who has reached the supreme condition of
an all-perfect Buddha; it is he, O prince of merchants, who is
called the Buddha.' 'In what place, gentlemen, does he now
reside?' 'At Srâvasti, O prince of merchants, in the wood of
Jetavana, in the garden of Anâtha-pindika.'" The result of
this conversation was that Pûrna, on his return, announced to
his brother his intention of becoming a monk, and advised him
never to go to sea, and never to live with his two brothers.
After this he went straight to Anâtha-pindika, and was by him
presented to the Buddha, who received him with the remark
that the most agreeable present he could have was a man to
convert. Pûrna then received the investiture and tonsure by
miracle, and was instructed in the law (in an abridged version)
by his master. A beautiful, and very characteristic conversation
follows the reception of the new doctrine. The Buddha
inquired of Pûrna where he would now reside, and the latter
(who intended to lead an ascetic life) replied that he would reside
"in the land of the Sronaparantakas.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> 'O Pûrna,' says
Gautama, 'they are violent, these men of Sronaparanta: they
are passionate, cruel, angry, furious, and insolent. When the
men of Sronaparanta, O Pûrna, shall address thee to thy face
in wicked, coarse, and insulting language, when they shall become
enraged against thee and rail at thee, what wilt thou
think of that?' 'If the men of Sronaparanta, O Lord, address
me to my face in wicked, coarse, and insulting language, if they
become enraged against me and rail at me, this is what I shall
think of that: They are certainly good men, these Sronaparantakas,
they are gentle, mild men, they who address me to my
face, in wicked, coarse and insulting language, they who become
enraged against me and rail at me, but who neither strike me
with the hand nor stone me.'" The rest must be given in an
abridged form. "But if they do strike thee with the hand or
stone thee?" "I shall think them good and gentle for not
striking me with swords or sticks." "And if they do that?"
"I shall think them good and gentle for not depriving me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456"> 456</span>
entirely of life." "And if they do that?" (What follows is literal.)
"If the men of Sronaparanta, O Lord, deprive me
entirely of life, this is what I shall think: There are hearers
of Bhagavat [the Lord] who by reason of this body full of
ordure, are tormented, covered with confusion, despised, struck
with swords, who take poison, who die of hanging, who are
thrown down precipices. They are certainty good people, these
Sronaparantakas, they are gentle people, they who deliver me
with so little pain from this body full of ordure." "Good, good,
Pûrna; thou canst, with the perfection of patience with which
thou art endowed, yes, thou canst live, thou canst take up thy
abode in the land of the Sronaparantakas. Go, Pûrna; delivered
thyself, deliver; arrived thyself at the other shore, cause
others to arrive there; consoled thyself, console; having come
thyself to complete Nirvâna, cause others to arrive there."</p>

<p>Hereupon Pûrna took his way to Sronaparanta, where he
converted a huntsman who had intended to kill him, and
obtained five hundred novices composed of both sexes.</p>

<p>After a time, Bhavila, his brother, was requested by Bhavatrata
and Bhavanandin to enter into partnership with them; and
his repugnance to the proposal was overcome by the reproaches
of his younger brothers, who said that he would never have
dared to go to sea as Pûrna had done. Stung by this taunt, he
engaged with them in a sea-voyage. The vessel was attacked
by a furious storm, raised by a demon in consequence of the
merchants having cut some sandal-wood which was under this
demon's protection. Bhavila stood dumbfounded; and when
the passengers inquired the reason, informed them that he was
thinking of his brother's advice never to go to sea. It turned
out that the merchants on board knew of Pûrna's great sanctity,
and they addressed their prayers to him. He came through the
air, after the manner of Buddhist ascetics, appeared sitting
cross-legged over the vessel, and allayed the tempest. The
vessel, loaded with sandal-wood, was brought safety back to
Surparaka. The sandal-wood Pûrna took possession of in order
to make a palace for the Buddha, and desired his brothers to
invite that personage and his disciples to a repast. The invitation
was miraculously conveyed to the Buddha (who was a long
way off, at Srâvasti), and he told his followers to prepare to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457"> 457</span>
accept it. Pûrna returned suddenly to the Assembly (around
Buddha) and performed a miracle. The king of Surparaka, on
his side, made preparations on the grandest scale for the reception
of the Buddhist hierarchy, which came to his city by all
kinds of supernatural means. Pûrna, standing by him, explained
the various prodigies as they occurred. Omitting some marvelous
conversions wrought by the Buddha on his way, it may be
mentioned that he descended into the middle of the town of
Surparaka from the air, and there taught the law, by which
hundreds of thousands of living beings attained the several
degrees of knowledge which lead, sooner or later, to salvation.</p>

<p>Passing over a passage in which two royal Nâgas (or serpent-kings)
make their appearance to receive the law, and another
in which Gautama proceeds to another universe to instruct the
mother of his disciple Maudgalyâyana, we arrive at the moral
which always forms the conclusion of these Buddhist tales.
The monks surrounding the Buddha inquired what actions
Pûrna had performed in order, first, to be born in a rich family;
secondly, to be the son of a slave; and lastly, "when he had
entered on a religious life, to behold the condition of an Arhat<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
face to face, after having annihilated all the corruptions of
evil?" Buddha replied, that in the very age in which we live,
but at a period of it when men lived twenty thousand years,
there was a venerable Tathâgata, or Buddha, named Kâsyapa,
who resided near Benares. Pûrna, who had adopted a religious
life under him, "fulfilled among the members of the Church<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
the duties of servant of the law." The servant of a certain
Arhat set himself to sweep the monastery, but the wind blowing
the dirt from side to side, he gave up the attempt, intending
to proceed when the wind should have abated. The servant
of the law coming in, and finding the monastery unswept,
allowed himself to be carried away by rage, and to utter these
offensive words: "This is the servant of some slave's son."<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458"> 458</span>
When he had had time to recover his calmness, the Arhat's
servant presented himself, and asked if he knew him. The servant
of the law replied that he did, and that they both had
entered into a religious life under the Buddha Kâsyapa. The
other rejoined that while he had fulfilled all his duties, the servant
of the law had been guilty of a fault in giving way to his
temper, and exhorted him to diminish that fault by confession.
The latter repented, and was thereby saved from re-birth in
hell; but he was doomed to be re-born for five hundred generations
in the womb of a slave. In this last existence he was
still the offspring of a slave; but because he had formerly
served the members of the Church, he was born in a rich and
prosperous family; and because he had formerly read and
studied Buddhist theology, he now became an Arhat under
Gautama Buddha, after annihilating evil (H. B. I., p. 235 ff.).</p>

<p>Such is a favorable specimen of a vast number of legends
contained in the Buddhist Canon. The following fragment is
of a rather different kind. It illustrates the extravagant adoration
paid to the person of Buddha some generations after his
death. A king named Rudrayana had sent to another, named
Bimbisâra, an armor of marvelous properties and priceless
value. Bimbisâra, at a loss what present he could send back
which would be a fitting return for such a gift, determined to
seek out Buddha and consult him on the point:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"King Bimbisâra addressed him thus:—'In the town of Rôruka,
Lord, there lives a king called Rudrayana; he is my friend; though I
have never seen him, he has sent me a present of an armor composed of
five pieces. What present shall I give him in return?' 'Have the representation
of the Tathâgata traced on a bit of stuff,' answered Bhagavat,
'and send it him as a present.'</p>

<p>"Bimbisâra sent for some painters, and said—'Paint on a bit of stuff
the image of the Tathâgata.' The blessed Buddhas are not very easy to
get at, which is the reason why the painters could find no opportunity
of [painting] Bhagavat. So they said to Bimbisâra—'If the king would
give a feast to Bhagavat in the interior of his palace, it would be possible
for us to seize the occasion of [painting] the blessed one' King
Bimbisâra having accordingly invited Bhagavat to his palace, gave him
a feast. The blessed Buddhas are beings that people are never weary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459"> 459</span>
looking at. Whichever limb of Bhagavat the painters looked at they
could not leave off contemplating it. So they could not seize the moment
to paint him. Bhagavat then said to the king—'The painters will have
trouble, O great king; it is impossible for them to seize the moment to
[paint the] Tathâgata, but bring the canvass.' The king having brought
it, Bhagavat projected his shadow on it, and said to the painters—'Fill
that outline with colors; and then write over it the formulas of refuge
as well as the precepts of instruction; you will have to trace both in the
direct order, and in the inverse order the production of the [successive]
causes [of existence], which is composed of twelve terms; and on it
will be written these two verses:</p>

<p>"'Begin, go out [of the house]; apply yourself to the law of Buddha;
annihilate the army of death, as an elephant upsets a hut of reeds.</p>

<p>"'He who shall walk without distraction under the discipline of
this law, escaping birth and the revolution of the world, will put an
end to sorrow.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>"'If any one asks what these verses are, you must answer: The
first is the introduction; the second, the instruction; the third, the
revolution of the world; and the fourth, the effort.'" (H. B. I., p. 341).</p>
</div>

<p>Bimbisâra, acting under Bhagavat's dictation, then wrote to
Rudrayana that he was about to send him the most precious
object in the three worlds, and that he must adorn the way by
which it would arrive for two and a half yojanas. Rudrayana
was rather irritated by this message, and proposed immediate
war, but was dissuaded by his ministers. The picture therefore
was received with all honor, and not uncovered till after it had
been duly adored. Certain foreign merchants who happened to
be on the spot, on seeing the portrait, cried out altogether:
"Adoration to Buddha." At this name the king felt his hair
stand on end, and inquired who Buddha was. His position, and
the meaning of the inscription, was explained to him by the
merchants. The consequence, as may be supposed, was his conversion
to Buddhism. He reflected on the causes of existence,
and attained the degree of Srotâpatti (H. B. I., p. 344.)</p>

<p>Very little allusion is made in these legends to the immediate
subject of the Vinaya-pitaka, namely, Discipline. But a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460"> 460</span>
reference to Csoma's Analysis of the Dulva (the Thibetan title
for the Vinaya) will show that it is in fact largely occupied in
laying down rules for the guidance of monks and nuns, these
rules being frequently supposed to have arisen out of particular
events, while "moral tales" are freely intermingled with the
treatment of the main business. The hap-hazard manner in
which the regulations needful for the government of the Church
were framed—according to the theory of the Scriptures—may
be illustrated by a few specimens. Thus, two persons in debt
had taken orders, "Shakya (Sakyamuni) prohibits the admission
into the religious order of any one who is in debt" (As.
Re., vol. xx. p. 53). This rule entirely agrees with the general
spirit of Gautama's proceedings, as narrated in the Buddhist
books, and we are warranted in supposing that statements so
harmonious rest on a historical foundation. Thus, he is said to
have refused to admit young people without the consent of
their parents, or servants of a king without their royal master's
sanction. Regulations like these may well have been made by
Buddha from a cautious anxiety to avoid all conflict with established
authorities. Further on in the same volume of the Dulva
the reception of hermaphrodites is likewise prohibited (As. Re.,
vol. xx. p. 55). On another occasion, leave is given to learn
swimming. "Indecencies" are then "committed in the Ajirapati
river. They are prohibited from touching any woman;—they
may not save even one that has fallen into the river" (Ibid.,
vol. xx. p. 59). Elsewhere we are told of a pious lady who provided
the infant community with cloth to make bathing clothes,
since she had heard that both monks and nuns bathed without
any garments (Ibid., vol. xx. p. 70). A little further on, the
dress of the priesthood is prescribed. Some of the disciples
wished to wear one thing, and some another; others to go
naked. "Shakya tells them the impropriety and indecency of
the latter, and prohibits it absolutely: and rebuking them, adds
that such a garb, or to go naked, is the characteristic sign of
a <i>Mu-stegs-chan</i> (Sansk) <i>Tîrthika</i>" (Ibid., vol. xx. p. 71). Here
again we seem to have a historical trait, for it was one of the
distinctive features of Buddhism that its votaries were never
naked, like the Tîrthikas, or heretical ascetics, but always wore
the yellow robe. In other places there are rules on lodging, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461"> 461</span>
bedding, on the treatment of quarrelsome priests, the use of
fragrant substances, and many other trivial points of ecclesiastical
discipline. The volumes containing all these instructions
are followed by one in which the same stories are told, and the
same morals deduced from them, concerning the nuns. Then
there are some injunctions apparently peculiar to this sex, as,
for instance, the restraint imposed on their possession of a
multiplicity of garments. Another prohibition was called forth
by the following conduct of a nun. A king had sent a piece of
fine linen cloth as a present to a brother king. "It comes
afterwards into the hands of <i>G</i>tsug-<i>D</i>gah-Mo (a lewd or wicked
priestess); she puts it on, appears in public, but from its thin
texture, seems to be naked. The priestesses are prohibited from
accepting or wearing such thin clothes" (As. Re., vol. xx. p. 85).</p>

<p>It will be observed from these few quotations that according
to the Canon the Buddha's usual mode of proceeding was to
lay down rules as occasion required. Some instructive anecdote
is related, and the new order follows as a natural consequence
of the event. More probably the rules were in fact made first,
and the anecdotes subsequently composed to account for them.
However this may be, there exist in the Canon some undoubtedly
ancient ordinances not called forth by any special circumstances,
conformity to which was required of the monks, if not
by their founder himself, at least by the rulers of his Church
in its most primitive condition. Such, for example, are "the
thirteen rules by which sin is shaken," reported by Burnouf,
which are also found, with the exception of a single one, in a
Chinese work entitled "the sacred book of the twelve observances"
(H. B. I., p. 304). These rules belong, according to
Burnouf, to an epoch when the organization of the monks
under a powerful hierarchy, and their residence in settled monasteries,
had scarcely begun. Some of them are even inconsistent
with the institution of such monasteries, or Viharis, which
are nevertheless very ancient. The fact that the above-named
Chinese treatise, the pentaglot Buddhist Vocabulary,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462"> 462</span>
list current among the Singhalese, all contain these articles of
discipline (though with slight variations) proves, moreover, that
they appertain to that common fund on which Northern and
Southern Buddhists drew alike. The first article (following the
order in the Vocabulary) signifies "wearing rags found in the
dust," and refers to an injunction addressed to the monks to
wear vestments composed of rags picked up in heaps of ordure,
in cemeteries, and such places. The second, "he who has
three garments," corresponds to an order found in the Chinese
book forbidding monks to have more than three garments.
Of the third article which is corrupt, Burnouf can give no satisfactory
explanation; and the fourth means "he who lives by
alms," a practice at all times imposed on the monastic orders.
Fifthly, the ascetic is described as "he who has but one seat;"
sixthly, as "one who eats no sweetmeats after his meal," all
eating for the day having to be finished by noon. Seventhly,
he "lives in the forest," that is, in lonely places; and eighthly,
he is "near a tree," the Chinese injunction requiring him to
sit near a tree, and to seek no shelter. The ninth order obliges
them to sit on the ground, that is, to live in the open air; the
tenth, to dwell among tombs, which the Singhalese interpret
as an order to visit cemeteries and meditate on the instability
of human affairs; the eleventh, to sit, and not to lie down.
Of the meaning of the twelfth there is some doubt; it may signify
that the monk is to remain where he is, or that he is not
to change the position of his mat when once laid down. To
these twelve the Singhalese add a thirteenth article, that the
monk is to live by begging from house to house.</p>

<p>Not less remarkable are the ten commandments of Buddhism,
which are doubtless also of considerable antiquity. Burnouf
states that he has found them in the sequel of the Prâtimoksha
Sûtra in the Pali-Burman copy of that most important
work (to which reference will shortly be made). These are the
ten commandments as given in that authority:—</p>

<p>1. Not to kill any living creature.</p>

<p>2. Not to steal.</p>

<p>3. Not to break the vow of chastity.</p>

<p>4. Not to lie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_463"> 463</span></p>

<p>5. Not to drink intoxicating liquors.</p>

<p>6. Not to take a meal except at the appointed time.</p>

<p>7. Not to visit dances, performances of vocal or instrumental music,
or dramatic representations.</p>

<p>8. Not to wear garlands, or use perfumes and unguents.</p>

<p>9. Not to sleep on a high or large bed.</p>

<p>10. Not to accept gold or silver (Lotus, p. 444).</p>


<p>Of these commandments, some are evidently general, being
founded on the fundamental principles of ethics; others are addressed
only to those in orders. Such is the case with the last
five, all of which bear reference to certain disciplinary laws imposed
upon the monks and nuns. Their object is to prohibit
luxury of various kinds, such as the use of a large bed, and to
restrain the love of sensual enjoyments, such as plays, music,
and dancing. Another list of offenses, after enumerating the
first five of those contained in the preceding list, adds five
more, namely:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. Blasphemy of the Buddha.</li>
<li>2. Blasphemy of the Law.</li>
<li>3. Blasphemy of the Church.</li>
<li>4. Heresy.</li>
<li>5. Violation of a nun (Lotus, p. 445).</li>
</ul>


<p>Such are the leading points of monastic discipline among the
primitive Buddhists. A more elaborate and formal treatise on
the subject of the sins to be avoided, and the penalties to be
imposed on their commission, is the Prâtimoksha Sûtra, or
Sûtra on Emancipation. It is the standard work on this subject,
and should be recited before the assembled Vihâra twice
in each month, any guilty brother confessing any transgression
of its precepts of which he might be conscious. Its antiquity
is undoubted, for in a Sûtra known to have been brought to
China from India in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70 (and therefore already of established
repute) the Prâtimoksha is referred to as the "two hundred and
fifty rules" (C. B. S., p. 189). It does, in fact, contain two hundred
and fifty rules in its Chinese form, while the Thibetan version
contains two hundred and fifty-three, and the Pali version
but two hundred and twenty-seven (H. B. I., p. 303). While the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464"> 464</span>
Prâtimoksha Sûtra now to be quoted is destined for monks, or
Bhikshus, it is to be noted that there exists likewise a "Bhikshunî
Prâtimoksha Sûtra," or Treatise on Emancipation for
Nuns (As. Re., vol. xx. pp. 79, 84). The rules are, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
the same for both sexes.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to glance rapidly at the nature of the
faults and crimes the confession of which is here imposed on
Bhikshus and Bhikshunîs.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Sûtra opens with certain stanzas designed to celebrate
the Buddhist Trinity,—the Buddha, the Law, and the Church.
Then follow some "preparatory questions:"—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Are the priests assembled? (They are.) Are all things arranged?
(seats, water, sweeping, &amp;c.) (They are.) Let all depart who are not ordained.
(If any, let them go; if none are present, let one say so.) Does
any Bhikshu here present ask for absolution? (Let him answer accordingly.)
Exhortation must be given to the priestesses (but if there are
none present, let one say so). Are we agreed what our present business
is? It is to repeat the precepts in this lawful assembly.</p>

<p>"Venerable brethren, attend now! On this ... day of the
month ... let the assembled priests listen attentively and patiently,
whilst the precepts are distinctly recited."</p>


<p class="center">COMMENCEMENT.</p>

<p>"Brethren! I desire to go through the Prâtimoksha. Bhikshus!
assembled thus, let all consider and devoutly reflect on these precepts.
If any have transgressed, let him repent! If none have transgressed,
then stand silent! silent! Thus, brethren, it shall be known that ye are
guiltless.</p>

<p>"Now if a stranger ask one of us a question we are bound to reply
truthfully: so, also, Bhikshus, we who reside in community, if we
know that we have done wrong, and yet decline to acknowledge it, we
are guilty of prevarication. But Buddha has declared that prevarication
effectually prevents our religious advancement. That brother,
therefore, who is conscious of transgression, and desires absolution,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465"> 465</span>ought at once to declare his fault, and after proper penance he shall have
rest and peace.</p>

<p>"Brethren! having repeated this preface, I demand of you all—Is
this assembly pure or not? (Repeat this three times.) Brethren! this
assembly is pure; silent! silent! ye stand! So let it be! Brethren, I
now proceed to recite the four parajika laws, ordered to be recited
twice every month."</p>
</div>

<p>These four laws are then repeated, and the penalty of excommunication,
which attaches to a breach of any of them, is
enunciated. The first of the four prohibits impure conduct;
the second, theft. The third runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If a Bhikshu cause a man's death, or hold a weapon and give it a
man (for the purpose), or if he speak of the advantages of death, or if
he carelessly exhort one to meet death (saying), 'Tush, you are a brave
man,' or use such wicked speech as this, 'It is far better to die and not
to live,' using such considerations as these, bringing every sort of expedient
into use, praising death, exhorting to death: this Bhikshu
ought to be excluded and cut off."</p>
</div>

<p>The fourth rule is against pretending to a perfect knowledge
of the Truth which the Bhikshu does not in fact possess.</p>

<p>At the end of the recitation of these four rules it is declared
that a brother who has transgressed any one of them "has
acquired the guilt which demands exclusion, and ought not to
live as a member of the priesthood." The question as to the
purity of the Assembly is then again put, and the priest (after
declaring it pure) proceeds to thirteen rules, the breach of which
is punished by suspension. The first restrains a monk from
pampering lustful thoughts, the second from bringing any part
of his body in contact with that of a woman, the third from
lewd talk with a woman, the fourth from obtaining a woman to
minister to him. For a violation of this last injunction the
highest penance, as well as suspension, is appointed. There
follow rules against building a residence of illegal size, or without
due consecration, or on an inconvenient site; against building
a Vihâra on an inconvenient site; against slander of a
Bhikshu (two rules), against causing disunion in a community,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466"> 466</span>
against forming a cabal for mutual protection against just censure,
against disorderly conduct when living in a house, against
a refusal to listen to expostulation or reproof. Solitary confinement,
and six days of penance, are the penalties imposed on
these offenses; after the infliction of the sentence absolution is
to be given. Next we have two rules "not capable of exact
definition," but relating to licentious talk with "a faithful laywoman."
Thirty rules relating to priests' robes and the like
matters are now recited. They seem to be aimed at covetousness
in receiving or asking gifts. After the usual inquiry as
to the purity of the brethren, ninety rules against offenses
requiring "confession and absolution" are to be read. Some of
these seem to be repetitions of previous ones belonging to a
more serious category, as the first two, on lying and slander,
and the eighth, against pretended knowledge. Then the Prâtimoksha
proceeds to say that if a Bhikshu use hypocritical language,
if he occupy the same lodging as a woman, or the same
as a man not yet ordained above two nights, if he chant prayers
with a man not yet ordained, if he rail at a priest, if he use
water containing insects (so as to destroy life), if he give clothes
to a Bhikshunî, or nun, if he go with a Bhikshunî in any boat
except a ferry-boat, if he agree to walk with a Bhikshunî along
the road, if he gambol in the water while bathing, if he drink
distilled or fermented liquor, or commit any of the many other
faults, partly against morality in general, partly against conventual
rule, he is guilty of a transgression of this class. Four
rules follow against receiving food from a nun, against allowing
a nun in a layman's house to point out certain dishes, and
have them given to certain monks; against going to dinner
uninvited; against the omission on the part of a monk residing
in a dangerous place to warn those who may bring him victuals
of the risk they run. A hundred rules, mostly trifling, are now
entered on. They are such as these: "Not to enter a layman's
house in a bouncing manner." "Not to munch or make a
munching noise in eating rice," and likewise, "not to make a
lapping noise." "Not to clean the teeth under a pagoda;"
with many other minute regulations on a multitude of trivial
points. The seven concluding laws refer simply to the mode of
deciding cases.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>The Sûtra-Pitaka.</i></h5>

<p>We have thus concluded our notice of the Prâtimoksha
Sûtra, and may pass on to the Sûtra-pitaka, the second of the
three baskets into which the Canon is divided. Sûtra is a term
signifying a discourse, or lecture, and the Sûtras of Buddhism
are frequently moral stories, supposed to emanate from Gautama
Buddha himself, and embodying the great features of his
gospel, as the Sermon on the Mount and the Parables do those
of the gospel of Jesus. A very interesting collection of such
stories belonging to the Sûtra-pitaka is contained in a work
translated from the Thibetan by a Russian scholar, and forming,
under the title of the <i>H</i>dsangs-<i>b</i>lun, or the Wise Man and
the Fool, a portion of the twenty-eighth volume of the <i>M</i>do, or
Sûtra-pitaka. From Csoma's Analysis it appears that many
other narratives of a similar nature are embodied in this section
of the Canon, though much of it also consists of more direct
dogmatic instruction. From "The Wise Man and the Fool"
I select a chapter which affords a good illustration of the
boundless charity which Buddhism inculcates.</p>

<p>The victoriously-perfect One was living at Srâvasti. When
the time came to receive alms, he set out with his disciple
Ananda, alms-bowl in hand, along the road. It so happened
that he met two men who had been condemned to death for
repeated robberies, and were being led to execution. Their
mother, seeing the Buddha, thus addressed him:—"O chief of
gods, think of us with mercy, and vouchsafe to take under thy
protection these my sons who are going to execution." Buddha
accordingly interceded with the king, who gave them a free
pardon. Touched with gratitude, the two men asked leave to
become monks, and on Buddha's consenting to receive them,
their hair at once fell off from head and face, and their garments
assumed the yellow hue of the order.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Both mother and
sons attained high spiritual grades. Ananda marveled what
good deeds these three could have performed to meet with the
victoriously-perfect One, to be saved from such great evils, and
to obtain the prospect of Nirvâna. Buddha thereupon informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468"> 468</span>
him that this was not the first occasion on which he had saved
their lives, and on Ananda's request for a further explanation,
related the following circumstances. Countless years ago, there
lived in Jambudwîpa (India) a certain king who had three sons.
The youngest son was mild and merciful from his childhood
upwards. One day, when the king, with his ministers, wives
and sons, was at a picnic outside the town, the three sons went
into a wood, where they found a tigress, with young recently
littered, so nearly starved that she was almost on the point of
devouring her own brood. The youngest asked his brothers
what food a tigress would eat. "Newly-killed meat and warm
blood." "Is there any one who would support its life with his
own body?" "No one," replied the elder brothers; "that
would be too difficult" (I give only the substance of this colloquy).
Then the youngest prince thought within himself:
"For a long time I have been driven about in the circle of
births, and have thrown away my body and my life innumerable
times; often have I sacrificed it for the passion of the desires,
often for that of rage, often too for folly and ignorance;
what value then has this body, which has not one single time
trodden the field of meritorious actions for the sake of religion!"
Meantime, all three had walked on; but the youngest, pleading
some business of his own, desired them to go on, leaving him
to follow. Having returned to the cave of the tigress, he laid
himself down beside her, but found her too weak to open her
mouth. Hereupon the prince contrived to bleed himself with a
sharp splinter of wood, and the tigress, after licking the blood
that flowed from him, was sufficiently refreshed to consume him
altogether. The two elder brothers, wondering at his long absence,
returned to the tiger's hole, where, on finding his remains,
they rolled upon the ground and fainted, overcome with grief.
The queen, who had had an alarming dream, questioned them
anxiously on their return as to their brother, and she too on
learning the sad event, which their choking voices for some time
prevented them from telling, fell senseless to the ground. Soon
after, both king and queen visited the den, but could find nothing
but bones. Meantime, the prince had been born again in
the Tushita heaven. Looking about to discover what good
action of his had brought him to this place, he saw the bones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469"> 469</span>
of his former body in the tigress's den, and his parents sighing
and groaning around them. He returned from his heavenly
abode to give them some consolation and some good advice.
They were at length somewhat comforted, and collecting his
bones, buried them in a costly sarcophagus.</p>

<p>Buddha then turns to Ananda and asks him whom he supposes
the actors in this tragedy to have been. He tells him,
without waiting for an answer, that the king was his present
father, the queen his present mother, the elder princes certain
personages named Maitreya and Vasumitra, and the youngest
prince no other than himself. The young tigers were, it need
hardly be said, the condemned felons whom he had now again
delivered from death.</p>

<p>While this anecdote inculcates charity in its fullest extent,
the one which is now to be quoted illustrates another most
conspicuous point in the ethics of Buddhism,—the regard paid
by it to personal purity and the deadening influence it exercised
on the senses. The translation of this curious legend is due to
Burnouf:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There was at Mathurâ a courtesan called Vâsavadattâ. Her maid
went one day to Upagupta to buy her some perfumes. Vâsavadattâ said
to her on her return: 'It seems, my dear, that this perfumer pleases
you, as you always buy from him.' The maid answered her: 'Daughter
of my master, Upagupta, the son of the merchant, who is gifted with
beauty, with talent, and with gentleness, passes his life in the observance
of the law.' On hearing these words Vâsavadattâ conceived an affection
for Upagupta, and at last she sent her maid to say to him: 'My intention
is to go and find you; I wish to enjoy myself with you.' The maid
delivered her message to Upagupta; but the young man told her to
answer her mistress: 'My sister, it is not yet time for you to see me.'
Now it was necessary in order to obtain the favors of Vâsavadattâ to
give five hundred Purânas. Thus the courtezan imagined that [if he
refused her, it was because] he could not give the five hundred Purânas.
For this reason, she sent her maid to him again to say, 'I do not ask a
single Kârchâpana from the son of my master; I only wish to enjoy myself
with him.' The maid again delivered this new message, and Upagupta
answered her in the same way: 'My sister, it is not time yet for
you to see me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_470"> 470</span></p>

<p>"However, the son of a master-workman had come to settle with
Vâsavadattâ, when a merchant, who was bringing from the north five
hundred horses which he wished to sell, came to the town of Mathurâ,
and asked who was the most beautiful courtezan. He was answered
that Vâsavadattâ was. Immediately, taking 500 Purânas and a great
number of presents, he went to the courtezan. Then Vâsavadattâ,
urged by covetousness, assassinated the son of the master-workman, who
was at her house, threw his body into the middle of the filth of the town,
and gave herself up to the merchant. After some days, the young man
was extricated from the filth by his parents, who denounced the murder.
The king at once gave orders to the executioners to go and cut off Vâsavadattâ's
hands, feet, ears, and nose, and to leave her in the cemetery.
The executioners carried out the orders of the king, and left the courtezan
in the place named.</p>

<p>"Now Upagupta heard of the punishment that had been inflicted on
Vâsavadattâ, and at once this idea came into his mind: 'Some time ago,
this woman wished to see me for a sensual object, and I did not consent
that she should see me. But now that her hands and feet, ears and nose,
have been cut off, it is time she should see me,' and he pronounced these
verses:</p>

<p>"'When her body was covered with beautiful attire, when she shone
with ornaments of different sorts, the best thing for those who aspired
to deliverance and who wished to escape the law of renewed birth was
not to go and see this woman.</p>

<p>"'To-day, when she has lost her pride, her love and her joy, when
she has been mutilated by the edge of the knife, when her body is
reduced to its true nature, it is time to see her.'</p>

<p>"Then sheltered by a parasol carried by a young man who accompanied
him as a servant, he went to the cemetery with a measured step.
Vâsavadattâ's maid had stayed with her mistress out of gratitude for
her past kindness, and she prevented the crows from approaching her
body. [Seeing Upagupta] she said to her: 'Daughter of my master, he
to whom you sent me several times, Upagupta, is coming this way. No
doubt he comes attracted by the desire for pleasure.' But Vâsavadattâ,
hearing these words, answered:</p>

<p>"'When he sees me deprived of beauty, racked with grief, lying on
the ground all covered with blood, how can he feel love of pleasure?'</p>

<p>"Then she said to her maid, 'Friend, pick up the limbs that have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471"> 471</span>
been severed from my body.' The maid picked them up at once, and hid
them under a bit of linen. At this moment Upagupta arrived, and he
stood up before Vâsavadattâ. The courtezan, seeing him standing up
before her, said to him: 'Son of my master, when my body was whole,
when it was made for enjoyment, I several times sent my maid to you,
and you answered me: "My sister, it is not time for you to see me."
To-day, when the knife has carried off my hands and feet, my ears and
nose, when I am thrown in the dirt and in blood, why do you come?'
And she uttered the following verses:</p>

<p>"'When my body was soft like the lotus flower, when it was adorned
with ornaments and rich clothes, when it had all which attracted the
eye, I was so unhappy as not to see you.</p>

<p>"'To-day why do you come to contemplate a body, the sight of
which the eyes cannot bear, which games, pleasure, joy, and beauty
have abandoned, which inspires horror, and is stained with blood and
dirt?'</p>

<p>"Upagupta answered her: 'I have not come to you, my sister,
attracted by the love of pleasure; but I am come to see the real nature
of the miserable objects of the enjoyments of man'" (H. B. I., p. 146 ff.).</p>
</div>

<p>Such is the character of the more ancient portions of the
Sûtra-pitaka. It consists largely of tales, most of which have
much the same outward form, the details only being varied;
and all of which are intended to impress some kind of moral
upon their hearers. But the Sûtra collection is composed of
two different classes of works, the one class being named by
Burnouf simple Sûtras, the other developed Sûtras. The developed
Sûtras belong, according to the same authority, to a much
later period, and are marked off from the simple Sûtras by
certain well-defined characters. They are indeed of a kind
which absolutely precludes the notion that they can emanate
in any way whatever from Sakyamuni, or that they could have
been composed during the modest beginnings of his Church,
when his followers were rather intent on practical goodness
than on pompous and high-flown descriptions of their Master's
magnificence. Not that all the Sûtras classed by Burnouf as
simple must needs belong to a very early age; but that the
developed Sûtras certainly could not have been written until
some centuries after Sakyamuni's death, when his disciples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472"> 472</span>
instead of using their voices in actual conversation, enjoyed the
leisure and the means to employ their pens in attempted fine
writing. Burnouf has given the public a single specimen of a
Sûtra of this class, and they must be very devoted students of
Oriental literature who wish for another. Here is a sample of
its style:—</p>

<p>"Then the Bodhisattva Mahâsattva Akshayamati having
risen from his seat, after throwing his upper garment over his
shoulder, and placing his right knee on the ground, directing
his joined hands, in token of respect, to the quarter where Bhagavat
was, addressed him in these words: 'Why, O Bhagavat,
does the Bodhisattva Mahâsattva Avalokitesvara bear that
name?' This having been said, Bhagavat spoke thus to the
Bodhisattva Akshayamati: 'O son of a family, all the hundreds
of thousands of myriads of creatures existing in the world who
suffer pains, have but to hear the name of the Bodhisattva
Avalokitesvara to be delivered from this mass of pains'"
(Lotus, p. 261).</p>

<p>The extraordinary diffuseness of this kind of composition is
scarcely credible. Not only is every doctrine elaborated in the
utmost number of words possible, but its exposition in prose is
regularly followed by a second exposition in verse. Add to this
peculiar feature of developed Sûtras another, namely, that
innumerable crowds of supernatural auditors (especially Bodhisattvas,
or future Buddhas) are present at their delivery by the
Buddha, and take part in the dialogue, or demand explanations
on knotty points, and some conception may be formed of their
wholly unreal and unnatural character. Thus, the Lotus concludes
with the statement that innumerable Tathâgatas (Buddhas)
come from other universes, seated on thrones near diamond
trees, innumerable Bodhisattvas, and the whole of the four
assemblies of the universe, with Devas (gods), men, Asuras, and
Gandharvas, transported with joy, praised what Bhagavat had
said. Although the simple Sûtras mention the presence of gods
at the Buddha's teaching, yet they do not (so far as I am
aware) introduce these hosts of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas
belonging to other worlds than ours. Their horizon had not
extended itself to such vast limits, and they confined themselves
to the universe in which we live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_473"> 473</span></p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 3.</span>—<i>The Abhidharma-pitaka.</i></h5>

<p>A third section of the Canon remains, the Abhidharma, or
Metaphysics. Buddhist metaphysics are so absolutely mystical
that it would be a waste of time to enlarge upon them in a
work not specially consecrated to Oriental subjects. The subtleties
of the Indian mind would require far more space to
explain than would be consistent with the objects in view here,
even if the writer were competent to explain them. The impression
left on the mind by the perusal of the Abhidharma is
that we delude ourselves if we believe in the reality of anything
whatever. There is no material world; all we see, hear, feel or
believe, is illusion; our thoughts themselves are no-thoughts;
this doctrine is that of wisdom and truth, but there is no wisdom
and no truth. The Buddha arrives by his meditations at
this sublime knowledge; but there is no meditation and no
knowledge. He conducts living creatures to Nirvâna: but there
are neither creatures to be conducted, nor a Buddha to conduct
them. All is nothingness, and nothingness is all. That this
nihilism is common to all the schools into which Buddhists are
divided, I do not mean to assert. There are in Nepaul certain
schools which hold a peculiar modification of theism, and they
probably may not embrace these strange and unintelligible systems.
But the views—if views they can be called—which have
just been described, do mark the canonical books of the Abhidharma
with which I am acquainted; such as the so-called
Pradjnâ Pâramitâ, or Perfection of Wisdom. There is, however,
one metaphysical theory which is not a mere series of contradictions,
and which, from its close connection with the deepest
roots of the Buddhistic faith, deserves more than a mere
cursory mention. It is the dogma known as that of the twelve
Nidânas, or successive causes of existence.</p>

<p>It has already been explained that the original aim of Buddhism—the
salvation offered by Sakyamuni—was deliverance
from this painful existence. The four truths which formed the
foundation of his system have also been spoken of. It may be
well to remind the reader that they are these:—1. The existence
of Pain; 2. The production of Pain; 3. The annihilation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474"> 474</span>
Pain; 4. The way to the annihilation of Pain. Now if existence
was, as the Buddhists believed, the source of pain, it was important
to discover the source of existence. This the theory of the
Nidânas professes to do. It is therefore not only intimately
related to the four great truths, but forms an essential supplement
to them. A very ancient formula, discovered not only in
books but on images, declares that, "Of all things proceeding
from cause, the cause of their procession hath the Tathâgata
explained. The great Sramana has likewise declared the cause
of the extinction of all things." Whether this formula refers to
the four truths, or to the Nidânas, it is impossible to say. The
Nidânas, however, might well be referred to in these terms.
They are described in a passage which Burnouf has quoted
from the Lalitavistara, in which the Bodhisattva (afterwards
Buddha) is stated to have risen through prolonged meditation
from the knowledge of each successive consequent to that of its
antecedent. The Bodhisattva, we are told, collected his thoughts
and fixed his intelligence in the last watch of night, just before
the dawn appeared. "Then this thought came into his mind:
The existence of this world, which is born, grows old, dies, falls,
and is born again, is certainly an evil. But he could not recognize
the means of quitting this world, which is nothing but a
great accumulation of sorrows, which is composed but of decrepitude,
illness, death, and other miseries, which are altogether
formed of them.</p>

<p>"This reflection brought the following thought into his
mind: What is the thing the existence of which leads to decrepitude
and death, and what cause have decrepitude and death?
This reflection came into his mind: Birth existing, decrepitude
and death exist; for decrepitude and death have birth as their
cause."</p>

<p>A similar process of reasoning led him to see that the cause
of birth was existence; that of existence, conception; that of
conception, desire; that of desire, sensation; that of sensation,
contact; that of contact, the six seats of sensible qualities; that
of the six seats, name and form; that of name and form, knowledge;
that of knowledge, the concepts; that of the concepts,
ignorance. "It is thus," exclaims the Bodhisattva when this
great light had burst upon him, "it is thus that the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475"> 475</span>
of this world, which is but a mass of sorrows, takes place."
And by an inverse process he went on to reflect that if ignorance
did not exist, neither would the concepts, and so on
through every link of the chain. Until at length, "from the
annihilation of birth results the annihilation of decrepitude, of
death, of sufferings, of lamentations, of sorrow, of regret, of
despair. It is thus that the annihilation of this world, which is
but a mass of sorrows, takes place" (H. B. I., p. 487).</p>

<p>This speculation is by no means easy to understand. Apparently
it means that ignorance, in the sense of a mistaken
notion of the reality of the material world, leads to a whole
series of blunders, ending inevitably in birth. From this fundamental
error or belief in the existence of sensible objects
spring certain other false conceptions. Knowledge, which next
ensues, may mean not merely cognition but consciousness,
knowledge of our existence; and in this sense, or in something
like it, it must be taken in order to explain the apparent paradox
of a deduction of the pedigree of knowledge directly from
ignorance. Hence name and form, a still further distinction of
the individual—a specialization of the vague knowledge of
himself which the last stage brought him to. The next step
carries us on to the six seats of sensible qualities; a phrase
expressing the organs by which sensible qualities are perceived—the
five senses, and <i>Manas</i>, the heart, which the Indians considered
as a sixth sense. It appears also from Burnouf's remarks
that the Sanskrit term includes along with the organs
the qualities they perceive, the Law being assigned to the heart
or internal sense as the object of its perception. The six
seats being given, contact follows; contact implies sensation,
and sensation naturally leads to desire. Conception is represented
as the effect of desire, but another translation of this
term by attachment, fondness for material things, renders the
sequence easier to understand. Attachment to anything but the
three gems—the Buddha, the Law, and the Church—is, however,
a fatal error, and leads to the melancholy result of existence.
Evidently, however, the being whose downward progress
has thus been described must have existed before, and the
event here alluded to must probably be the passage into the
definite condition of the human embryo. And this is rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476"> 476</span>
confirmed by the fact that the next step is that of birth, followed,
as a matter of course, by the miseries of human life,
terminating in death.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> And death, unless every remnant of
attachment to, and desire for, all worldly things has been
purged away, unless every trace of sinful tendencies has been
obliterated, is but a fresh beginning of the same weary round.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 4.</span>—<i>Theology and Ethics of the Tripitaka.</i></h5>

<p>Thus we have examined in succession the three great divisions
of the Buddhist Canon. We may pass over a comparatively
late and spurious addition to it, the Tantras—full of the worship
of strange gods and goddesses, and of magical formularies—to
consider the general features of these sacred works in reference
to their theological teaching and to their moral tendency.
Theology is perhaps a term that will be held to be misplaced
in speaking of a system which acknowledges no God. Yet
Buddhism is so full of supernatural creatures, and the Buddha
himself occupies a position so nearly divine, that it would be
hard to find a more appropriate word. Buddha himself is the
central figure of the whole of his system, far more completely
than Christ is the central figure of Christianity, or Mahomet of
Islam. There is no Deity above him; he stands out alone,
unrivaled, unequaled, and unapproachable. The gods of the
Hindu pantheon are by no means annihilated in the Buddhist
Scriptures. On the contrary, they play a certain part in them,
as when some of the greatest among their number assist at the
delivery of Mâyâ. But the part assigned to them is always a
subordinate one; they are practically set aside, not by the skeptical
process of questioning their existence, but by the more
subtle one of introducing them as humbly seated at the Buddha's
footstool, and devout recipients of his instructions. Hostility
to Gautama Buddha there may be, but not from them.
It proceeds from heretical Brahmans—rivals in trade—and
from those whom they may for a time deceive. The gods are
among the most docile of his pupils, and display a praiseworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477"> 477</span>
eagerness to acquire the knowledge he may condescend to impart.
Infinitely above gods and men, because possessing infinitely
deeper knowledge and infinitely higher virtue, stands the
Tathâgata, the man who walks in the footsteps of his predecessors.
His position is the greatest to which any mortal creature
can attain. But it has been attained by many before, and
will be by many hereafter. Far away into ages separated from
ours by millions of millions of years stretches the long list of
Buddhas, for every age has received a similar light to lighten
up its darkness. All have led lives marked by the same incidents,
and have taught the same truths. But by and by the
darkness has returned; the doctrines of the former Buddha
have been forgotten, and a new one has been needed. Then
in due season he has appeared, and has again opened to mankind
the path of salvation. Thus Kâsyapa Buddha preceded
Gautama Buddha, and Maitreya (now a Bodhisattva) will succeed
him. The Buddha is an object of the most devout adoration.
Prayers are addressed to him; his relics are enshrined in
Stûpas, or buildings erected by the piety of believers to cover
them; his footprints are viewed with reverential awe, and his
tooth, preserved in Ceylon, receives the constant homage of
that pious population. Thus his position is not unlike that of a
true Deity, though the theory of Buddhism would require us to
suppose that he is non-existent, and therefore wholly unable to
aid his worshippers. But this theory is not acted upon, and is
probably not held in all its strictness; for Buddha—though to
some extent superseded in Northern Buddhism by other divinities—is
the object of a decided worship in both its elements of
prayer and praise.</p>

<p>But the preëminent station occupied by a Buddha is not
reached without a long and painful education. Through ages,
the length of which is scarcely to be expressed by numbers,
they are qualifying themselves for their glorious task. During
this period they are termed Bodhisattvas, that is, beings who
have taken a solemn resolution to become Buddhas, and are
practicing the necessary virtues. The very fact of taking this
resolution is an exercise of exalted benevolence, for their excellence
is such that they might, if they pleased, enter at once
into Nirvâna. But such is their love for the human race, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478"> 478</span>
they prefer to be born again and again in a world of woe, in
order to throw open Nirvâna to others besides themselves. To
attain their end, they must make an offering to some actual
Buddha, wishing at the same time that by virtue of this act
they may become Buddhas themselves; and they must receive
an assurance from the object of their gift that this wish will be
fulfilled. Thus Gautama, who happened at the time to be a
prince, presented a golden vessel full of oil to a Buddha named
Purana Dîpankara, with the wish alluded to, and was assured
by him that he would in a future age become a supreme
Buddha (M. B., p. 92). The tales of the pains endured, the sacrifices
made, the virtues practiced by Gautama during this probationary
period are numerous and varied. He himself, by
virtue of his faculty of knowing the past, related them to his
disciples. He had sacrificed wife, children, property, even his
own person, for the good of other living creatures; he had endured
all kinds of sufferings; he had shown himself capable of
the rarest unselfishness, the most perfect purity, the most
unswerving rectitude. The tale of his endurances might move
compassion, had it not been crowned at last with the highest
reward to which a mortal can aspire.</p>

<p>While the Buddha occupies the first rank among human and
superhuman beings, and a Bodhisattva the second, the Scriptures
introduce us to others holding very conspicuous places
among the spiritual nobility. Such, for instance, are the Pratyeka
Buddhas. These are persons of very high intelligence and
very extraordinary merit. But they are unable to communicate
their knowledge to others. They can save themselves; others
they cannot save. Herein lies their inferiority to supreme
Buddhas,—that while their spiritual attainments are sufficient
to ensure their entry into Nirvâna, they are inadequate to enable
them to obtain the same privilege for any other person.</p>

<p>In addition to these not very interesting Buddhas, the
legends speak of certain grades of intelligence attained by
Gautama's hearers. Thus, we are often told that many of the
audience—perhaps hundreds of thousands—after hearing a sermon
from him, became Arhats; others are said to have become
Anâgâmin, Sakridâgâmin, or Srotâpanna. These degrees are
based upon the reception of the four truths. According to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479"> 479</span>
manner in which a man received these truths, he entered one
of eight paths, each of the four degrees having two classes, a
higher and a lower one. Sometimes these paths are called
"fruits;" a disciple is said to obtain the fruits of such and such
a state. An Arhat is a person of very high station indeed.
Excepting a Buddha, none is equal to him, either in knowledge
or miraculous powers, both of which he possesses to a preëminent
extent. The Arhat after his death enters at once into Nirvâna.
The Anâgâmin enters the third path (from the bottom),
and is exempt from re-birth except in the world of Devas, or
gods. He who obtains or "sees" the fruit of the second path
is born once more in the world of gods or in that of men.
Finally, the Srotâpanna undergoes re-birth either among gods
or men seven times, and is then delivered from the stream of
existence.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Below the fortunate travelers along the path stands the mass
of ordinary believers. All of these, of course, aim ultimately—or
should aim—at that perfection of knowledge and of character
which ensures Nirvâna; but in popular Buddhism at the
present day this distant goal appears to be well-nigh forgotten,
and to have given place to some heaven, or place of enjoyment,
above which the general hope does not rise.</p>

<p>Believers in general are divided into two classes, Bhikshus
and Bhikshunîs, or monks and nuns; and Upâsakas, lay disciples.
The distinction between these classes is well illustrated
by the following extract from a sacred book, the consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480"> 480</span>
of which will lead us from the domain of theology into that of
morality:—"What is to be done in the condition of a mendicant?—The
rules of chastity must be observed during the whole
of life.—That is not possible; are there no other means?—There
are others, friend; namely, to be a devotee (Upâsaka).—What
is to be done in this condition?—It is necessary during
the whole of one's life to abstain from murder, theft, pleasure,
lying, and the use of intoxicating liquors." The injunctions
thus stated to be binding on the laity are in fact the first five
of the ten commandments, pleasure being simply a designation
of unchastity, which the layman as well as the monk is here
ordered to eschew. The first five commandments are in fact
general, referring to universal ethical obligations, not merely
to monastic discipline, like the other five. But Buddhist morality
is by no means merely negative. It enjoins not only abstinence
from such definite sins as these, but the practice of positive
virtues in their most exalted forms. In no system is benevolence,
or, as it is termed in the English New Testament, charity,
more emphatically inculcated. Exhibited, as we have seen
it is, in the highest degree by Buddha himself, it should be
illustrated to the extent of their capabilities by all his followers.
Chastity is the subject of almost equal praise. And the other
virtues come in for their share of recognition, the general object
of the examples held up to admiration being to exhort the
faithful to a life spotless in all its parts, like that of their master.
With this aim the legends related generally fall into some
such form as this: Characters appear who undergo some suffering,
but receive also some great reward, such as meeting
with Buddha, and embracing his religion. It is then explained
by Buddha that the sufferings were the result of some bad action
done in a former life, and the benefit received the result of
some good action; while he will probably add that he himself
in that bygone age stood in the relation of a benefactor to the
recipient of his faith. Or a number of persons are introduced
playing various parts, good and evil, and receiving blessings or
misfortunes. One of these is conspicuous by the excellence of
his conduct. Then, at the end of the story, the disciples are
told not to imagine that this model of virtue is any other than
Sakyamuni himself, while the other characters are translated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481"> 481</span>
according to their special peculiarities, each into some individual
living at the time, and forming either one of Buddha's retinue,
or connected with him by ties of kindred, or (if wicked)
marked by hostility to his person or doctrine. Thus, the bad
parts in these dramas are often allotted to his cousin Devadatta,
who figures in these Scriptures as his typical opponent.</p>

<p>The essential doctrine of all these moral fictions—the corner-stone
of Buddhist ethics—is that every single act of virtue
receives its reward, every single transgression its punishment.
The consequences of our good deeds or misdeeds, mystically
embodied in our Karma, follow us from life to life, from earth
to heaven, from earth to hell, and from heaven or hell to earth
again. Karma expresses an idea by no means easily seized.
Perhaps it may be defined as the sum total of our moral actions,
good and bad, conceived as a kind of entity endowed with the
force of destiny. It is our Karma that determines the character
of our successive existences. It is our Karma that determines
whether our next birth shall be in heaven or hell, in a
happy or miserable condition here below. And as Karma is
but the result of our own actions, each of which must bear its
proper fruit, the balance, either on the credit or debit side of
our account, must always be paid; to us or by us, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate this by an instance or two. A certain
prince, named Kunâla, remarkable for his personal beauty, had
been deprived of his eyes through an intrigue in his father's
harem. Sakyamuni, in pointing the moral, informs his disciples
that Kunâla had formerly been a huntsman, who finding five
hundred gazelles in a cave, had put out their eyes in order to
preclude their escape. For this cruelty he had suffered the
pains of hell for hundreds of thousands of years, and had then
had his eyes put out in human existences. But Kunâla also
enjoyed great advantages. He was the son of a king, he possessed
an attractive person, and, above all, he had embraced the
truths of Buddhism. Why was this? Because he had once
caused a Stûpa of a former Buddha, which an unbelieving monarch
had suffered to be pulled to pieces, to be rebuilt, and had
likewise restored a statue of this same Buddha which had been
spoilt (H. B. I., p. 414). The truly Buddhistic spirit of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482"> 482</span>
young prince is evinced by the circumstance that he interceded
earnestly with his father for the pardon of his stepmother who
had caused him to be so cruelly mutilated.</p>

<p>In another case, a poor old woman, who had led a miserable
existence as the slave of an unfeeling master and mistress, was
re-born in one of the heavens, known as that of the three-and-thirty
gods. Five hundred goddesses descended to the cemetery
where she had been heedlessly thrown into the ground, strewed
flowers on her bones, and offered them spices. The reason of
all this honor was, that on the previous day she had met with
Kâtyâyana, an apostle of Buddhism, had drawn water and presented
it to him in his bowl, and had consequently received a
blessing from him, with an exhortation to enter her mistress's
room after she had gone to sleep, and sitting on a heap of hay
to fix her mind exclusively upon Buddha. This advice she had
attended to, and had consequently received the above-named
reward (W. u. T., p. 153).</p>

<p>Good and evil, under this elaborate system, are thus the
seeds which, by an invariable law, produce their appropriate
fruits in a future state. The doctrine may in fact be best
described in the words attributed to its author:—"A previous
action does not die; be it good or evil, it does not die; the
society of the virtuous is not lost; that which is done, that
which is said, for the Aryas,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> for these grateful persons, never
dies. A good action well done, a bad action wickedly done,
when they have arrived at their maturity, equally bear an inevitable
fruit" (H. B. I., p. 98).</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section V.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Zend-Avesta.</span><a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></h4>

<p>Persia was once a great power in the world; the Persian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483"> 483</span>
religion, a conquering and encroaching faith. The Persian
Empire threatened to destroy the independence of Greece. It
held the Jews in actual subjection, and its religious views profoundly
influenced the development of theirs. Through the
Jews, its ideas have penetrated the Christian world, and leavened
Europe. It once possessed an extensive and remarkable sacred
literature, but a few scattered fragments of which have descended
to us. These fragments, recovered and first translated by Anquetil
du Perron, have been but imperfectly elucidated as yet
by European scholars; and there can be no doubt that much
more light remains to be cast upon them by philology as it progresses.
Such as they are, however, I shall make use of the
translations already before us to give my readers an imperfect
account of the character of the Parsee Scriptures.</p>

<p>These compositions are the productions of several centuries
and are widely separated from one another in the character of
their thought, and in the objects of worship proposed to the
faithful follower of Zarathustra. The oldest among them,
which may belong to the time of the prophet himself, are considered
by Haug to be as ancient as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 1200, while the youngest
were very likely as recent as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 500.</p>

<p>Haug considers the Avesta to be the most ancient text, while
the Zend was a kind of commentary upon this already sacred
book.</p>

<p>Taking the several portions of the Zend-Avesta in their chronological
order (as far as this can be ascertained), we shall
begin with the five Gâthâs, which are pronounced by their
translator to be "by far the oldest, weightiest, and most important
pieces of the Zend-Avesta" (F. G., xiii). Some portions of
these venerable hymns are even attributed by him to Zarathus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484"> 484</span>tra
himself; but this—except where the prophet is in some way
named as the author—must be considered only as an individual
opinion, which can carry no positive conviction to other minds
until it is supported by stronger evidence than any at present
accessible. Meantime, we may rest assured that we possess
among these hymns some undoubted productions of the Zarathustrian
age.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span>—<i>The Five Gâthâs.</i></h5>

<p>Proceeding to the individual Gâthâs, we find that the first,
which begins with the 28th chapter of the Yaçna, bears the following
heading: "The revealed Thought, the revealed Word,
the revealed Deed of the truthful Zarathustra.—The immortal
saints chanted the hymns."<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The Gâthâ Ahunavaiti—such is its title—then proceeds:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "Adoration to you, ye truthful hymns!</p>

<p>2. "I raise aloft my hands in devotion, and worship first all true
works of the wise and holy Spirit, and the Understanding of the pious
Disposition, in order to participate in this happiness.</p>

<p>3. "I will draw near to you with a pious disposition, O Wise One!
O Living One! with the request that you will grant me the mundane
and the spiritual life. By truth are these possessions to be obtained,
which he who is self-illuminated bestows on those who strive for them"
(F. G., vol. i. p. 24.—Yaçna, xxviii. 1-3).</p>
</div>

<p>The most important portion of this Gâthâ is the 30th chapter,
because in it we have a vivid picture of the conflict in
which the religion of Ahura-Mazda was born. Philological
inquiry has rendered it clear beyond dispute, that Parseeism
took its rise in a religious schism between two sections of the
great Aryan race, at a period so remote that the occupation of
Hindoostan by an offshoot of that race had not yet occurred.
The common ancestors of Hindus and Persians still dwelt
together in Central Asia, when the great Parsee Reformation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485"> 485</span>
disturbed their harmony; the one section adopting, or adhering
to, the Vedic polytheism which they subsequently carried to
India; the other embracing the more monotheistic creed which
afterwards became the national religion of Persia.</p>

<p>The following hymn of the reformers carries us into the very
midst of the strife:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "I will now tell you who are assembled here, the wise sayings of
the most wise, the praises of the living God, and the songs of the good
spirit, the sublime truth which I see arising out of these sacred flames.</p>

<p>2. "You shall, therefore, hearken to the soul of nature (<i>i. e.</i>, plough
and cultivate the earth);<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> contemplate the beams of fire with a most
pious mind! Every one, both men and women, ought to-day to choose
his creed (between the Deva and the Ahura religion). Ye offspring of
renowned ancestors, awake to agree with us (<i>i. e.</i>, to approve of my lore,
to be delivered to you at this moment)!"</p>
</div>

<p>(The prophet begins to deliver the words, revealed to him
through the sacred flames.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3. "In the beginning there was a pair of twins, two spirits, each of
a peculiar activity; these are the good and the base, in thought, word,
and deed. Choose one of these two spirits! Be good, not base!</p>

<p>4. "And these two spirits united created the first (material things);
the one, the reality, the other, the non-reality. To the liars (the worshipers
of the devas, <i>i. e.</i>, gods) existence will become bad, whilst the
believer in the true god enjoys prosperity.</p>

<p>5. "Of these two spirits you must choose one, either the evil, the
originator of the worst actions, or the true holy spirit. Some may wish
to have the hardest lot (<i>i. e.</i>, those who will not leave the polytheistic
deva-religion), others adore Ahura-Mazda by means of sincere actions.</p>

<p>6. "You cannot belong to both of them (<i>i. e.</i>, you cannot be worshipers
of the one true God and of many gods at the same time). One
of the devas, against whom we are fighting, might overtake you, when
in deliberation (what faith you are to embrace), whispering you to
choose the no-mind. Then the devas flock together to assault the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486"> 486</span>
lives (the life of the body, and that of the soul), praised by the prophets"
(Parsees, pp. 141, 142.—Yasna, 30).</p>
</div>

<p>In another portion of this Gâthâ it is interesting to observe
the spirit of religious zeal breaking out, as it so generally does,
into the language of persecution:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>xxxi. 18. "Do not listen to the sayings and precepts of the wicked
(the evil spirit), because he has given to destruction house, village, district,
and province. Therefore kill them (the wicked) with the sword!"</p>
</div>

<p>The wicked, as appears from the context, are those who did
not accept the Zarathustrian revelation.</p>

<p>In the second Gâthâ, or Gâthâ Ustavaiti, there are some very
curious passages. A few have been quoted in the notice of
Zarathustra. The following verses indicate the nature of the
worship addressed to Ahura-Mazda in the most ancient period
of the Parsee religion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>xliii. 2. "I believe thee to be the best thing of all, the source of
light for the world. Everybody shall choose thee (believe in thee) as
the source of light, thee, thee, holiest spirit Mazda! Thou createst all
good true things by means of the power of thy good mind at any time,
and promisest us (who believe in thee) a long life.</p>

<p>4. "I will believe thee to be the powerful, holy (god) Mazda! For
thou givest with thy hand, filled with helps, good to the pious man, as
well as to the impious, by means of the warmth of the fire strengthening
the good things. For this reason the vigor of the good mind has fallen
to my lot.</p>

<p>5. "Thus I believe in thee as the holy God, thou living Wise One!
Because I beheld thee to be the primeval cause of life in the creation.
For thou hast made (instituted) holy customs and words, thou hast given
a bad fortune (emptiness) to the base, and a good one to the good man.
I will believe in thee, thou glorious God! in the last (future) period of
creation" (Parsees, p. 149).</p>

<p>xliv. 3. "That which I shall ask thee, tell it me right, thou living
God! Who was in the beginning the father and creator of truth? Who
made the way for the sun and stars? Who causes the moon to increase
and wane, if not thou? This I wish to know besides what I already
know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_487"> 487</span></p>

<p>4. "That I will ask thee, tell it me right, thou living God! Who is
holding the earth and the skies above it? Who made the waters and
the trees of the field? Who is in the winds and storms that they so
quickly run? Who is the creator of the good-minded beings, thou Wise
One?</p>

<p>5. "That I will ask thee, tell it me right, thou living God! Who
made the lights of good effect and the darkness? Who made the sleep
of good effect and the activity? Who made morning, noon and night,
always reminding the priest of his duties?" (Ibid., p. 150.)</p>

<p>xlvi. 7. "Who is appointed protector of my property, Wise One!
when the wicked endeavor to hurt me? Who else, if not thy fire, and
thy mind, through which thou hast created the existence (good beings),
thou living God! Tell me the power necessary for holding up the
religion" (Ibid., p. 156).</p>
</div>

<p>The third Gâthâ is termed Çpeñta-Mainyus. It begins with
praise of Ahura-Mazda as the giver of the two forces of perfection
and immortality. From this holiest spirit proceeds all the
good contained in the words uttered by the good mind. He is
the father of all truth. Of such a spirit is he who created this
earth with the fire resting in its lap. Ahura-Mazda placed the
gift of fire in the sticks that are rubbed together by the duality
of truth and piety. The following verse refers to Mazda's
prophet, Zarathustra:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>xlviii. 4. "He who created, by means of his wisdom, the good and
the no-mind in thinking, words, and deeds, rewards his obedient followers
with prosperity. Art thou (Mazda) not he in whom the last cause
of both intellects (good and evil) is <i>hidden</i>?" (Parsees, p. 159).</p>
</div>

<p>The concluding chapter of this Gâthâ is a hymn of praise
supposed to emanate from the Spirit of Earth and to be addressed
to the highest genii. It is not without beauty and sublimity,
but I forbear to make quotations from it, as some of its
most interesting verses are noticed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth Gâthâ are much shorter, and are considered
by Haug as an appendix. The following verse may
serve as a specimen of the former:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488"> 488</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>lii. 20. "May you all together grant us this your help, truth through
the good mind, and the good word in which piety consists. Be lauded
and praised. The Wise One bestows happiness.</p>

<p>21. "Has not the Holy One, the living wise one, created the radiant
truth, and possession with the good mind by means of the wise sayings
of Ârmaiti, by her actions and her faith?</p>

<p>22. "The living Wise One knows what is always the best for me in
the adoration of those who existed and still exist. These I will invoke
with mention of their names, and I will approach them as their panegyrist"
(F. G., vol. ii. p. 56).</p>
</div>

<p>Of the first three verses of the fifth Gâthâ I have spoken
above (p. 184). The fourth and fifth run thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>liii. 4. "I will zealously confess this your faith, which the blessed
one destined to the landlord for the country people, to the truthful
householder for the truthful people, ever extending the glory and the
beauty of the good mind, which the living Wise One has bestowed on
the good faith for ever and ever.</p>

<p>5. "I proclaim formulæ of blessing to girls about to be married:
Attend! attend to them! You possess by means of those formulæ the
life of the good mind. Let one receive the other with upright heart;
for thus only will you prosper" (F. G., vol. ii. p. 57).</p>
</div>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>Yaçna 35-41, or the Yaçna of seven chapters.</i></h5>

<p>The Yaçna of seven chapters, which in the present arrangement
of the text is inserted between the first and second
Gâthâs, is of more recent date than the Gâthâs, but more
ancient than the rest of the Zend-Avesta. "It appears to be
the work of one of the earliest successors of the prophet,
called in ancient times <i>Zarathustra</i> or <i>Zarathustrotema</i>, who,
deviating somewhat from the high and pure monotheistic principles
of Çpitama, made some concessions to the adherents of
the ante-Zoroastrian religion by addressing prayers to other
beings than Ahura-Mazda" (Parsee, p. 219). The seven chapters
may be most accurately described as Psalms of praise, in which
a great variety of objects, spiritual and natural, receive a tribute
of pious reverence from the worshiper. They are not, however,
on that account to be considered as gods, or as in any way the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489"> 489</span>
equals of Ahura-Mazda, who is still supreme. The beings thus
addressed are portions of the "good creation," or of the things
created by the good power, Ahura-Mazda; and they are either
subjects of his spiritual kingdom, such as the Amesha-çpentas
(seven very important spirits), or they are simply portions of
the material universe treated as semi-divine, and exalted to objects
of religious worship. Thus in the last chapter of this section,
the author directs his laudations to the following, among
other, genii and powers: the dwelling of the waters, the parting
of the Ways, mountains, the wind, the earth, the pure ass
in Lake Vouru-Kasha, this lake itself, the Soma, the flowing of
the waters, the flying of the birds. It is plain from this enumeration
that we are already a step beyond the simple adoration
of Ahura-Mazda so conspicuous in the Gâthâs, and that the
door is opened to the multitude of spirits and divinities that
make their appearance in other parts of the Parsee ritual.</p>

<p>This section of the Yaçna opens, however, with a striking
address to Ahura-Mazda:<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>xxxv. 1. "We worship Ahura-Mazda the pure, the master of purity.
We worship the Amesha-çpentas (the archangels), the possessors of good,
the givers of good. We worship the whole creation of the true spirit,
both the spiritual and terrestrial, all that supports (raises) the welfare of
the good creation, and the spread of the good Mazdayaçna religion.</p>

<p>2. "We praise all good thoughts, all good words, all good deeds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490"> 490</span>
which are and will be (which are being done and which have been done)
and we likewise keep clean and pure all that is good.</p>

<p>3. "O Ahura-Mazda, thou true happy being! we strive to think,
to speak, and to do only those of all actions which might be best
fitted to promote the two lives (that of the body and of the soul).</p>

<p>4. "We beseech the spirit of earth by means of these best works
(agriculture) to grant us beautiful and fertile fields, to the believer as
well as to the unbeliever, to him who has riches as well as to him
who has no possession" (Parsees, p. 163).</p>
</div>

<p>The following invocation of fire deserves to be mentioned
before we quit this portion of the Yaçna:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>xxxvi. 4. "Happy is the man to whom thou comest in power, O
Fire, Son of Ahura-Mazda.</p>

<p>5. "Friendlier than the friendliest, more deserving of adoration
than the most adorable.</p>

<p>6. "Mayest thou come to us helpfully to the greatest of transactions....</p>

<p>9. "O Fire, Son of Ahura-Mazda, we approach thee</p>

<p>10. "with a good spirit, with good purity" (Av., ii. 137).</p>
</div>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 3.</span>—<i>Yaçna, Chapter XII.</i></h5>

<p>This chapter is stated by Haug to be written in the Gâthâ
dialect; it is therefore extremely ancient, and as it contains the
Confession of Faith made by Zarathustrian converts on their
abandonment of idolatry, or worship of the Devas, it is of sufficient
importance to be quoted at length:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>xii. 1. "I cease to be a Deva <i>worshiper</i>. I profess to be a Zoroastrian
Mazdayaçna (worshiper of Ahura-Mazda), an enemy of the Devas, and a
devotee to Ahura, a praiser of the immortal saints (Amesha-çpentas), a
worshiper of the immortal saints. I ascribe all good things to Ahura-Mazda,
who is good, and has good, who is true, lucid, shining, who is
the originator of all the best things, of the spirit in nature (gâus), of the
growth in nature, of the luminaries and the self-shining brightness which
is in the luminaries.</p>

<p>2. "I choose (follow, profess) the holy Ârmaiti, the good; may she be
mine! I abominate all fraud and injury committed on the spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491"> 491</span>
earth, and all damage and destruction of the quarters of the Mazdayaçnas.</p>

<p>3. "I allow the good spirits who reside on this earth in the good animals
(as cows, sheep, &amp;c.), to go and roam about free according to their
pleasure. I praise, besides, all that is offered with prayer to promote
the growth of life. I shall cause neither damage nor destruction to the
quarters of the Mazdayaçnas, neither with my body nor my soul.</p>

<p>4. "I forsake the Devas, the wicked, bad, false, untrue, the originators
of mischief, who are most baneful, destructive, the basest of all
beings. I forsake the Devas and those who are Devas-like, the witches
and their like, and any being whatever of such a kind. I forsake them
with thoughts, words and deeds: I forsake them hereby publicly, and
declare that every lie and falsehood is to be done away with.</p>

<p>5, 6. "In the same way as Zarathustra at the time when Ahura-Mazda
was holding conversations and meetings with him, and both were conversing
with each other, forsook the Devas; so do I forsake the Devas,
as the holy Zarathustra did.</p>

<p>7. "To that party to which the waters belong, to whatever party the
trees, and the animating spirit of nature, to that party to which Ahura-Mazda
belongs, who has created this spirit and the pure man; to that
party of which Zarathustra, and Kava Vistâçpa and Frashaostra and
Jâmâçpa were, of that party of which all the ancient fire-priests (Soshyañto)
were, the pious, who were spreading the truth: of the same party
and creed <i>am</i> I.</p>

<p>8. "I am a Mazdayaçna, a Zoroastrian Mazdayaçna. I profess this
religion by praising and preferring it to others (the Deva religion). I
praise the thought which is good, I praise the word which is good, I
praise the work which is good.</p>

<p>9. "I praise the Mazdayaçna religion, and the pure brotherhood
which it establishes and defends against enemies, the Zoroastrian Ahura
religion, which is the greatest, best, and most prosperous of all that are,
and that will be. I ascribe all good to Ahura-Mazda. This shall be
the praise (profession) of the Mazdayaçna religion."</p>
</div>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 4.</span>—<i>The Younger Yaçna, and Vispered.</i></h5>

<p>While the Gâthâs and the confession just quoted represent
the most ancient phase of the Mazdayaçna faith, we enter, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492"> 492</span>
the remaining portion of the Yaçna, on a much later stage of
the growing creed. So many new divinities, or at any rate,
objects of reverential addresses, now enter upon the scene, that
we almost lose sight of Ahura-Mazda in the throng of his attendants.
We seem to be some ages away from the days when
Zarathustra bade his hearers choose between the one true God
and the multitude of false gods worshiped by his enemies.
Ahura-Mazda is safely enthroned, and Zarathustra shines out
gloriously as his prophet; but Zarathustra's creed is overloaded
with elements of which he himself knew nothing. The first
chapter of the Yaçna, a liturgical prayer, brings these elements
conspicuously before us. It is an invocation and celebration of
a great variety of powers belonging to what is termed the good
creation, or the world of virtuous beings and good things, as
opposed to the malicious beings and bad things who form the
realm of evil.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Thus it opens:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I invoke and I celebrate the creator Ahura-Mazda, luminous,
resplendent, very great and very good, very perfect and very energetic,
very intelligent and very beautiful, eminent in purity, who possesses the
excellent knowledge, the source of pleasure; him who has created us,
who has formed us, who has nourished us, the most accomplished of
intelligent beings."<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Every verse, until we approach the end, commences with the
same formula:—"I invoke and I celebrate;" or, as Spiegel
translates it, "I invite and announce it;" the sole difference is
in the beings invoked. Many of these are powers of more or
less eminence in the Parsee spiritual hierarchy, but it would be
going beyond our object here to enumerate their names and specify
their attributes. To a large proportion of them the epithets
"pure, lord of purity," are added, while some are dignified with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493"> 493</span>
more special titles of honor. After the above homage to Ahura-Mazda,
the writer invokes and celebrates, among others: Mithra
(a very famous god), who increases oxen, who has one thousand
ears, and ten thousand eyes; the fire of Ahura-Mazda; the
water given by Ahura-Mazda; the Fravashis (angels or guardian
spirits) of holy men and of women who are under men's protection;
energy, with a good constitution and an imposing figure;
victory given by Ahura; the months; the new moon; the
full moon; the time of fecundation; the years; all the lords of
purity, and thirty-three genii surrounding Hâvani, who are of
admirable purity, whom Mazda has made known, and Zarathustra
has proclaimed; the stars, especially a star named Tistrya;
the moon, which contains the germ of the ox; the sun, the eye
of Ahura-Mazda; the trees given by Mazda; the Word made
known by Zarathustra against the Devas; the excellent law of
the Mazdayaçnas; the perfect benediction; the pure and excellent
man; these countries and districts; pastures and houses;
the earth, the sky, the wind; the great lord of purity; days,
months, and seasons; the Fravashis of the men of ancient law;
those of contemporaries and relations, and his own; all genii
who ought to be invoked and adored. It is manifest from this
invocation, in which I have omitted many names and many
repetitions, how far we are from the stern and earnest simplicity
of the Gâthâs. Regular liturgical forms have sprung up, and
these express the more developed and complicated worship which
the Parsee priesthood has now engrafted on the Zarathustrian
monotheism.</p>

<p>The concluding verses run as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O thou who art given in this world, given against the Devas, Zarathustra<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
the pure, lord of purity, if I have wounded thee, either in
thought, word, or deed, voluntarily or involuntarily, I again address
this praise in thine honor; yes, I invoke thee if I have failed against
thee in this sacrifice and this invocation.</p>

<p>"O all ye very great lords, pure, masters of purity, if I have
wounded you, &amp;c. [as above].</p>

<p>"May I, a worshiper of Mazda, an adherent of Zarathustra, an
enemy of the Devas, an observer of the precepts of Ahura, address my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494"> 494</span>
homage to him who is given here, given against the Devas; to Zarathustra,
pure, lord of purity, for the sacrifice, for the invocation, for the
prayer that renders favorable, for the benediction. (May I address my
homage) to the lords (who are) the days, the parts of days, &amp;c., for the
benediction; that is to say: (may I address my homage) to the lords (who
are) the days, the parts of days, the months, the seasons of the year
(Gahanbârs), the years; for the sacrifice, for the invocation, for the
prayer that renders favorable, for the benediction."<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The rest of the Yaçna consists mainly of praises or prayers
addressed to the very numerous objects of Parsee adoration,
and most of it is of little interest. The following short section,
however, deserves remark:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Yaçna 12.</i></p>

<p>1. "I praise the thoughts rightly thought, the words rightly spoken,
and the deeds rightly done.</p>

<p>2. "I seize upon (or resort to) all good thoughts, words and deeds.</p>

<p>3. "I forsake all bad thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>

<p>4. "I bring you, O Amesha-çpentas,</p>

<p>5. "Praise and adoration,</p>

<p>6. "With thoughts, words, and deeds, with heavenly mind, the
vital force from my own body."<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the following verses again there is some excellence:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "May that man attain that which is best who teaches us the right
way to our profit in this world, both the material and the spiritual
world, the plain way that leads to the worlds where Ahura is enthroned,
and the sacrificer, resembling thee, a sage, a saint, O Mazda.</p>

<p>2. "May there come to this dwelling contentment, blessing, fidelity,
and the wisdom of the pure."</p>

<p>8. "In this dwelling may Çraosha<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> (obedience) put an end to disobedience,
peace to strife, liberality to avarice, wisdom to error, truthful
speech to lying, which detests purity" (Av. ii. 186, 187.—Yaçna 59).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495"> 495</span></p>

<p>The prominent position occupied by fire in the Parsee faith
is well known. The presence of fire is indeed an essential part
of their ritual, in which it is treated with no less honor than
the consecrated wafer in that of Catholic Christians. Not only,
however, is it employed in their rites, but it is addressed as an
independent being, to whom worship is due. Not that its place
in the hierarchy is to be confounded with that of Ahura-Mazda.
It is not put upon a level with the supreme being, but it is addressed
as his son, its rank being thus still more closely assimilated
to that of the host, which is in like manner a part of the
liturgical machinery and an embodiment of the son of God. A
special chapter of the Yaçna—the 61st—is devoted to Fire, and
a summary of its contents will help us to understand the light
in which this deity was regarded.</p>

<p>The sacrificer begins by vowing offerings and praise and
good nourishment to "Fire, son of Ahura-Mazda." He trusts
that Fire may ever be provided with a proper supply of wood,
and may always burn brightly in this dwelling, even till the
final resurrection. He beseeches Fire to give him much property,
much distinction, holiness, a ready tongue, wit and understanding,
activity, sleeplessness, and posterity. Fire is said to
await nourishment from all; whoever comes, he looks at his
hands, saying: "What does the friend bring his friend, the
coming one to him who sits alone?" And this is the blessing
he bestows on him who brings him dry wood, picked out for
burning: "Mayest thou be surrounded with herds of cattle,
with abundance of men. May it be with thee according to the
desire of thy heart, according to the desire of thy soul. Be
joyous, live thy life the whole time that thou shalt live."<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The last chapter but one of the Yaçna is a hymn in universal
praise of the good creation. All the objects belonging to that
creation—that is, made by Ahura-Mazda, and standing in contrast
with the bad creation of Agra-Mainyus—are enumerated,
and as a catalogue of these the hymn is interesting. Ahura-Mazda
himself is named first; then Zarathustra; after this follows
the Fravashi (angel) of Zarathustra, the Amesha-çpentas,
the Fravashis of the pure, and so forth, through a long list of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496"> 496</span>
animate and inanimate beings. Each is named with the formula
"we praise" following the title, as: "The whole earth we
praise" (Av., vol. ii. p. 202.—Yaçna, 70).</p>

<p>So close is the resemblance between the Vispered and that
portion of the Yaçna which we have just examined, that it will
be needless to dwell upon the contents of the former. We may
therefore at once pass on to a very important section, for theological
purposes, of the Zend-Avesta, namely—</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 5.</span>—<i>Vendidad.</i></h5>

<p>Totally unlike either the Yaçna, the Vispered, or the Yashts,
the Vendidad is a legislative code—dealing indeed largely with
religious questions, but not confining itself exclusively to them.
It differs from the remainder of the sacred volume much as
Leviticus differs from the Psalms, or as the Institutes of Menu
differ from the hymns of the Rig-Veda. It is regarded as
equally holy with the rest of the Avesta, and is recited in
divine service along with Vispered and Yaçna, the three together
forming what is termed the Vendidad-Sade (Av., ii. lxxv).
Its abrupt termination indicates that the code is not before us
in its entirety; the portion which has been preserved, however,
does not appear to have suffered great mutilation. Let us
briefly summarize its contents, first premising that the form
they assume (with trifling exceptions) is that of conversations
between Ahura-Mazda and his prophet.</p>

<p>The first Fargard (or chapter) is an enumeration of the good
countries or places created by Ahura-Mazda, and of the evils—such
as the serpent, the wasp, and various moral offenses,
including that of doubt—created in opposition to him in each
case by the president of the bad creation, Agra-Mainyus. The
second Fargard is a long narrative of the proceedings of a
mythological hero named Yima (the Indian Yama), to whom
Ahura-Mazda is stated to have once committed the government
of the world, or of some part of it. Thus far we have not
entered on the proper subject-matter of the Vendidad. The
third Fargard, while still introductory, approaches more nearly
to the subsequent chapters, alike in its form and its contents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497"> 497</span>
In it Zarathustra lays certain queries before Ahura-Mazda, and
the replies given by that deity are of high importance for the
comprehension of both the social and moral status of the
Parsees at the time when this dialogue was written. The stress
laid upon the virtue of cultivating the soil is especially to be
noticed. Similar sentiments are frequently repeated in the
Vendidad, and indicate a people among whom agriculture was
still in its infancy, the transition from the pastoral state to the
more settled condition of tillers of the soil being still incomplete.
The compilers of this code evidently felt strongly the
extreme value to their youthful community of agricultural
pursuits, and therefore encouraged them at every convenient
opportunity by representing them as peculiarly meritorious in
the sight of God.</p>

<p>Zarathustra begins his inquiries by asking what is in the
first place most agreeable to this earth, and successively ascertains
what are the five things which give it most satisfaction,
and what the five which cause it the most displeasure.
Ahura-Mazda answers that, in the first place, a holy man
with objects of sacrifice is the most agreeable; then a holy man
making his dwelling-place, and storing it with all that pertains
to a happy and righteous life; then the production of grain and
of fruit trees, the irrigation of thirsty land, or the drainage of
moist land; fourthly, the breeding of live-stock and draught-cattle;
fifthly, a special incident connected with the presence
of such animals on the land. The five displeasing things are,
the meetings of Daevas and Drujus (evil spirits), the interment
of men or dogs (which was contrary to the law), the accumulation
of Dakhmas, or places where the bodies of the dead were
left exposed, the dens of animals made by Agra-Mainyus, and
lastly, unbecoming conduct on the part of the wife or son of a
holy man. Further questions are then put as to the mode of
conduct which wins the approbation of the earth, and it is
stated to consist in actions which tend to counteract the evils
above enumerated. In the course of these replies occasion is
again taken to eulogize the man who vigorously cultivates the
soil, and to censure him who idly leaves it uncultivated. Certain
penalties are then imposed on those who bury dogs or
men, but the sin of leaving them underground for two years is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498"> 498</span>
declared to be inexpiable, except by the Mazdayaçna Law,
which can purify the worst offenders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For it (the Law) will take away these (sins) from those who praise
the Mazdayaçna Law, if they do not again commit wicked actions. For
this the Mazdayaçna Law, O holy Zarathustra, takes away the bonds of
the man who praises it. It takes away deceit. It takes away the murder
of a pure man. It takes away the burial of the dead. It takes away inexpiable
actions. It takes away accumulated guilt. It takes away all
sins which men commit" (Av., vol. i. p. 87, 88.—Vendidad, iii. 140-148).</p>
</div>

<p>We see from this that the power of the Law to deliver sinners
from the burden of their offenses was in no way inferior
to that of the Atonement of Christ.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the fourth Fargard, which
deals with the penalties—consisting mainly of corporal punishment—for
breach of contract and other offenses. The fifth and
sixth, being concerned with the regulations to be observed in
case of impurity arising from the presence of dead bodies, are of
little interest. A large part of the seventh is occupied with the
same subjects, but its course is interrupted by certain precautions
to be attended to in the graduation of students of medicine,
which may be commended to the notice of other religious
communities. Should a Mazdayaçna desire to become a physician,
on whom, inquires Zarathustra, shall he first try his hand,
the Mazdayaçna (orthodox Parsees), or the Daevayaçnas (adherents
of a false creed)? Ahura-Mazda replies that the Daevayaçnas
are to be his first patients. If he has performed three surgical
operations on these heretics, and his three patients have
died, he is to be held unfit for the medical profession, and
must on no account presume to operate on the adherents of the
Law. If, however, he is successful with the Daevayaçnas, he is
to receive his degree, and may proceed to practice on the more
valuable bodies of faithful Parsees. So careful a contrivance to
ensure that none but infidels shall fall victims to the knife of
the unskilful surgeon evinces no little ingenuity.</p>

<p>The eighth Fargard relates chiefly to the treatment of dead
bodies, while the ninth proceeds to narrate the rites for the purification
of those who have come in contact with them. A terri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499"> 499</span>ble
penalty—that of decapitation—is enacted against the man
who ventures to perform this rite without having learnt the
law from a priest competent to purify. The tenth Fargard prescribed
the prayers by which the <i>Drukhs</i>, or impure spirit supposed
to attach itself to corpses, and to come from them upon
the living, is to be driven away: and the subject is continued
in the eleventh, which contains formularies for the purification of
dwellings, fires, and other objects. Along with injunctions as to
the purification of houses where a death has occurred, the
twelfth Fargard informs its hearers how many prayers they
are to offer up for deceased relatives. The number varies both
according to their relationship, being highest for those that are
nearest akin, and according to their purity or sinfulness, double
as many being required for the sinful as for the pure. After a
short introduction expounding the merit of killing a certain
species of animal and the demerit of killing another (what they
are is uncertain), the thirteenth Fargard proceeds to enumerate
in detail the various kinds of offenses against dogs, and the corresponding
penalties. Dogs were evidently of the utmost importance
to the community, and their persons are guarded with
scarcely less care than those of human beings. They are held
to have souls, which migrate after their decease to a canine
Paradise. It seems, too, that shades of departed dogs are
appointed to watch the dangerous bridge over which men's
souls must travel on the road to felicity, and which the wicked
cannot pass; for we are informed of the soul of a man who has
killed a watch-dog, that "the deceased dogs who guard against
crime and watch the bridge do not make friends with it on
account of its abominable and horrible nature" (Av., vol. i. p.
192.—Vendidad, xiii. 25); while a man who has killed a water-dog
is required to make "offerings for its pious soul for three
days and three nights" (Av., vol. i. p. 201.—Vendidad, xiii. 173).
The place to which the souls of these animals repair is termed
"the water-dwelling," and it is stated that two water-dogs
meet them on their arrival, apparently to welcome them to
their aqueous heaven (Av., vol. i. p. 200.—Vendidad, xiii. 167). Not
only killing dogs, but wounding them or giving them bad food,
are crimes to be severely punished; and even in case of madness
the dog's life is on no account to be taken. On the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500"> 500</span>trary,
the utmost care is to be taken, by fastening him so as to
prevent escape, that he should do himself no injury, for if he
should happen in his madness to fall into water and die, the
community will have incurred sin by the accident.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The following
verses convey an interesting notion of the esteem in which
the dog was held among the early Parsees. The speaker is
Ahura-Mazda:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have created the dog, O Zarathustra, with his own clothes and
his own shoes; with a sharp nose and sharp teeth; attached to mankind,
for the protection of the herds. Then I created the dog, even I Ahura-Mazda,
with a body capable of biting enemies. When he is in good
health, when he is with the herds, when he is in good voice, O holy Zarathustra,
there comes not to his village either thief or wolf to carry off
property unperceived from the villages" (Av., vol. i. p. 197.—Vendidad,
xiii. 106-113).</p>
</div>

<p>In the fourteenth Fargard, water-dogs are further protected
against wounds; while in the fifteenth, the preservation of the
canine species at large is ensured by elaborate enactments. To
give a dog bones which he cannot gnaw, or food so hot as to
burn its tongue, is a sin; to frighten a bitch in pup, as by clapping
the hands, is likewise to incur guilt; and they are gravely
criminal who suffer puppies to die from inattention. If born in
camel-stalls, stables, or any such places, it is incumbent on the
proprietor to take charge of them; or, if the litter should be
at large, at least the nearest inhabitant is bound to become
their protector. Strangely intermingled with these precautions
are rules prohibiting cohabitation with women in certain physical
conditions, and enactments for the prevention of abortion,
and for ensuring the support of a pregnant girl by her seducer,
at least until her child is born. The crime of abortion is
described in a manner which curiously reveals the practices
occasionally resorted to by Parsee maidens. Should a single
woman be with child, and say, "The child was begotten by
such and such a man"—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501"> 501</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If then this man says, 'Try to make friends with an old woman
and inquire of her; if then this girl does make friends with an old
woman, and inquire of her, and this old woman brings Baga, or Shaêta,
or Ghnâna, or Fraçpâta, or any of the vegetable purgatives, saying, 'Try
to kill this child;' if then the girl does try to kill the child, then the
girl, the man, and the old woman are equally criminal."</p>
</div>

<p>Neither the sixteenth nor the seventeenth Fargard need detain
us. They relate, the one to the above-mentioned rules to
be observed towards women, the other to the disposal of the
hair and nails, which are held to pollute the earth. The eighteenth
Fargard begins, as if in the middle of a conversation, with
an address by Ahura-Mazda, on the characteristics of true and
false priests, some, it appears, having improperly pretended to
the priesthood. After some questions on other points of doctrine
put by Zarathustra, we are suddenly introduced to a conversation
between the angel Çraosha and the Drukhs, or evil
spirit, in which the latter describes the several offenses that
cause her to become pregnant, or, in other words, increase her
influence in the world. After this interlude, we return to Ahura-Mazda
and Zarathustra. The prophet, having been exhorted to
put questions, inquires of his god who causes him the greatest
annoyance. Ahura-Mazda replies that it is "he who mingles
the seed of the pious and the impious, of Daeva-worshipers
and of those who do not worship the Daevas, of sinners and
non-sinners." Such persons are "rather to be killed than poisonous
snakes." Hereupon Zarathustra proceeds to ascertain
what are the penalties for those who cohabit with women at
seasons when the law requires them to be separate. At the
beginning of the nineteenth Fargard, we have an account of
the temptation of the prophet by the evil one, to which allusion
has been made in another place. Zarathustra seeks for information
as to the means of getting rid of impurities, and is
taught by Ahura-Mazda to praise the objects he has created. In
the latter part of the chapter we have a remarkable account of
the judgment of departed souls. In conclusion, we have a
psalm of praise recited by the prophet in honor of God, the
earth, the stars, the Gâthâs, and numerous other portions of
the good creation. There is little in the twentieth Fargard be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502"> 502</span>yond
the information that Thrita was the first physician, and a
formula of conjuration, apparently intended to be used in order
to drive away diseases. In the twenty-first, we find praises of
the cloud, the sun, and other heavenly bodies. The last Fargard
of the Vendidad differs widely from the rest in its manner
of representing Ahura-Mazda. It is, no doubt, as Spiegel
observes, of late origin. Ahura-Mazda complains of the opposition
he has encountered from Agra-Mainyus, who has afflicted
him with illness (whether in his own person, or in that of
mankind, is not clear). He calls upon Manthra-Çpenta, the
Word, to heal him, but that spirit declines, and a messenger is
accordingly sent to Airyama to summon him to the task.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Airyama commences his preparations on an extensive scale, but
at this point the Vendidad breaks off, and we are left in doubt
as to the result of his efforts.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 6.</span>—<i>The Khorda-Avesta, with the Homa Yasht.</i></h5>

<p>The term Khorda-Avesta, or little Avesta, is applied, according
to Spiegel, to that part of the Zend-Avesta which includes
the Yashts, and certain prayers, some of them of extreme sanctity,
and constantly employed in Parsee worship. He informs
us that, while the remainder of the sacred texts serve more
especially for priestly study and for public reading, the Khorda-Avesta
is mainly used in private devotion (Av., vol. iii. p. 1).
Some of its prayers belong to a comparatively recent period,
being composed no longer in the Zend language, but in a
younger dialect; and we meet in them with the Persian forms
of the old names—Ormazd standing for Ahura-Mazda, Ahriman
for Agra-Mainyus, and Zerdoscht for Zarathustra. The names
of the genii have undergone corresponding alterations. We find
ourselves in these prayers, and indeed throughout the Yashts,
many centuries removed from the age of Zarathustra and his
immediate followers. Some of the more celebrated prayers,
however (not belonging to the class of Yashts), must be of considerable
antiquity, if we may judge from the fact of their being
mentioned in the Yaçna. Thus, in the 19th chapter of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503"> 503</span>
Yaçna, we find an elaborate exaltation of the powers of the
Ahuna-Vairya, which stands second in the Khorda-Avesta.
Zarathustra is represented as asking Ahura-Mazda, "What was
the speech which thou spokest to me, as existing before the
sky, before the water, before the earth, before the ox, before
the trees, before the fire, son of Ahura-Mazda, before the pure
men, before the Daevas with perverted minds, and before men,
before the whole corporeal world, before all things created by
Mazda which have a pure origin?" This speech, existing prior
to all created objects, is declared to have been a part of the
Ahuna-Vairya. The immense benefits of repeating this prayer,
which is stated to ensure salvation, are then recounted to the
prophet. The 20th chapter is occupied with the merits of another
of these short formularies, the Ashem-vohû. These prayers
are in continual use, not only in the liturgy, but among the
laity. They are sometimes required to recite great numbers of
Ahuna-Vairyas at one time, and at the commencement of sowing,
or of any good work, it is proper to repeat it. The Ashem-vohû
is to be said on various occasions, particularly on waking
and before going to sleep (Av., vol. ii. pp. lxxxii., lxxxiii). The
higher sanctity, as well as greater antiquity, of these prayers is
evinced by the fact that we find them constantly introduced in
the course of others, to which they form a necessary supplement.
There are often several Ashem-vohûs in a single brief
prayer. The Ashem-vohû, in fact, fulfills a function much like
that of the Lord's prayer in the liturgies of some Christian
Churches.</p>

<p>Let us now see what these most sacred forms of adoration
contain. The Ashem-Vohû is to this effect:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Purity is the best possession.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail, hail to him:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Namely, to the pure man best in purity."<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is strange that, in a formulary occupying so conspicuous
a place in Parsee devotion, there should be no acknowledgment
of God. But this want is supplied in the Ahuna-Vairya,
or Yathâ-ahû-vairyo, which follows it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504"> 504</span></p>

<p>Yathâ-ahû-vairyo:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As it is the Lord's will, so (is he) the ruler from purity.</p>

<p>(We shall receive) gifts from Vohu-mano for the works (we do) in the
world for Mazda.</p>

<p>And (he gives) the kingdom to Ahura who protects the poor" (Av.,
vol. iii.—Khorda-Avesta, 2).</p>
</div>

<p>Certainly this is not very intelligible, but the last clause is
remarkable, as implying that the way to advance God's kingdom
on earth is to confer benefits on the poor.</p>

<p>Passing over a number of other prayers, we enter upon the
Yashts, which are distinguished from all other parts of the
Avesta by the fact that each of them is written in celebration
of some particular god or genius. Ahura-Mazda, indeed, still
retains his supremacy, and every Yasht begins with a formula,
of which the first words are "In the name of the God Ormazd,"
while the first Yasht is devoted exclusively to his praise. Subject
to this recognition, however, the inferior potentates are
each in turn the object of panegyrics in that exaggerated
style in which Oriental literature delights. We need not
stop to recount the particular honors rendered to each. One
Yasht, however, is sufficiently curious to merit our attention,
the more so as we possess a translation of it by Burnouf.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It is
termed the Homa Yasht, and is intended to extol the brilliant
qualities of the god whose name it bears. At that period of the
day which is termed Hâvani—so it begins—Homa came to
find Zarathustra, who was cleaning his fire, and singing the
Gâthâs. "Zarathustra asked him: 'What man art thou who in
all the existing world appearest to my sight as the most perfect,
with thy beautiful and immortal person?' Then Homa,
the holy one, who banishes death, answered me: 'I am, O
Zarathustra, Homa, the holy one, who banishes death. Invoke,
O Çpitama,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> extract me to eat me, praise me to cele<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505"> 505</span>brate
me, in order that others, who desire their good, may
praise me in their turn.' Then Zarathustra said: 'Adoration to
Homa! Who is the mortal, Homa, who first in the present
world extracted thee for sacrifice? What holiness did he acquire?
What advantage accrued to him thereby?'" Homa
replies that Vivanghat was the first to extract him for sacrifice,
and that he acquired the advantage of becoming father to the
glorious Yima, in whose reign "there was neither cold nor
(excessive) heat, nor old age nor death, nor envy produced by
the Deva. Fathers and sons alike had the figure of men of fifteen
years of age, as long as Yima reigned." Similar questions
are then put by Zarathustra regarding the second, third, and
fourth mortals who worshiped Homa, and similar replies are
given. All had distinguished sons; but the last, Puruchaspa,
was rewarded beyond all others by the birth of Zarathustra
himself. Homa thereupon magnifies Zarathustra in the usual
style of the later parts of the Zend-Avesta, and Zarathustra,
who is not to be outdone in the language of compliment, thus
addresses him in return: "Adoration to Homa! Homa, the good,
has been well made; he has been made just; made good; he
bestows health; he has a beautiful person; he does good; he is
victorious; of the color of gold; his branches are inclined to be
eaten; he is excellent; and he is the most celestial way for the
soul. O thou who art of the color of gold, I ask thee for prudence,
energy, victory, beauty, the force that penetrates the
whole body, greatness which is spread over the whole figure;"
and so forth, through several other by no means modest petitions.
In a more formal manner Zarathustra then demands of
Homa the following favors: 1st, the excellent abode of the
saints; 2dly, the duration of his body; 3dly, a long life; 4thly,
and 5thly, to be able to annihilate hatred and strike down the
cruel man; 6thly, that they (the faithful?) may see robbers,
assassins, and wolves before being seen by them. After this,
Homa is praised generally. He gives many good gifts, among
them posterity to sterile mothers, and husbands to spinsters of
advanced years. He is finally requested, if there should be in
the village or the province a man who is hurtful to others, to
take from him the power of walking, to darken his intelligence,
and to break his heart (For another Yasht, see ch. i).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_506"> 506</span></p>

<p>The Yashts are succeeded by various pieces, of which one
relates to Parsee eschatology, and the others, celebrating numerous
supernatural objects of worship, do not call for any special
remark. After these we come to the so-called Patets, which
belong to the most recent portions of the book, and indicate a
highly developed consciousness of sin, and of the need of
divine forgiveness. They correspond in tone and character to
the General Confession which has been placed by the Church
of England in the forefront of her Liturgy, except that they
contain long enumerations of the several classes of offenses for
which pardon is to be entreated. One of them, after such a catalogue,
thus addresses the Deity:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Whatever was the wish of the Creator Ormazd, and I ought to
have thought and did not think, whatever I ought to have said and did
not say, whatever I ought to have done and did not do.—I repent of
these sins, with thoughts, words, and works, both the corporeal and
the spiritual, the earthly and the heavenly sin, with the three words
(that is, with thoughts, words, and works). Forgive, O Lord; I repent
of the sin.</p>

<p>"Whatever was the wish of Ahriman, and I ought to have thought
and yet did think, whatever I ought not to have said and yet did say,
whatever I ought not to have done and yet did,—I repent of these sins
with thoughts, words, and works, both the corporeal and the spiritual,
the earthly and the heavenly sins, with the three words. Forgive, O
Lord; I repent of the sin" (Av., vol. iii. p. 211.—Khorda-Avesta,
xlv. 8, 9).</p>
</div>

<p>Another of these Patets contains the following comprehensive
formula:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In whatever way I may have sinned, against whomsoever I may
have sinned, howsoever I may have sinned, I repent of it with thoughts,
words, and works; forgive!" (Av., vol. iii. p. 216.—Khorda-Avesta,
xlv. 1.)</p>
</div>

<p>The same Patet contains a confession of faith, which, as it
alludes to the several dogmas that were held to be of first-rate
importance in the creed of the true disciple of Zarathustra, may
be worth quoting before we quit the subject:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_507"> 507</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I believe in the existence, the purity, and the indubitable truth of
the good Mazdayaçna faith, and in the Creator Ormazd and the Amschaspands,
in the exaction of an account, and in the resurrection of the
new body. I remain in this faith, and confess that it is not to be
doubted, as Ormazd imparted it to Zertuscht, Zertuscht to Fraschaostra
and Jâmâçp, as Âderbât, the son of Mahresfand, ordered and purified
it, as the just Paoiryotkaeshas and the Deçtûrs in family succession have
brought it to us, and I thence am acquainted with it" (Av., vol. iii. p.
218.—Khorda-Avesta, xlv. 28).</p>
</div>

<p>In more than one respect this confession is interesting.
First, it asserts the excellence and the unquestionable infallibility
of the traditional faith in terms which a Catholic could
hardly improve upon. Secondly, it brings before us in succinct
form the leading points included in that faith—the Creator, at
the head of all the created world; the seven Amschaspands or
Amesha-Çpentas, heavenly powers of whom Ormazd himself
was chief; the judgment to be expected after death, and the
strict account then to be required; lastly, the general resurrection
with its new body. Proceeding next to the manner in
which this faith had been handed down from generation to
generation, we have first the cardinal doctrine that God himself
was the direct teacher of his prophet; after that, a statement
that the prophet communicated it to others, from whom it
descended to still later followers, one of whom is declared to
have "ordered and purified it." Thus the consciousness of
subsequent additions to the original law is betrayed. Thus
amended, the priests, or Deçtûrs, are said to have transmitted
it to the time of the speaker, the authority of the ecclesiastical
order in the interpretation of the sacred records being thus
carefully maintained.</p>

<p>How many generations had elapsed before the transmission
of the law could thus become the subject of deliberate incorporation
among recognized dogmas, it is impossible to say.
Undoubtedly, however, we stand a long way off—not only in
actual time, but in modes of thought and forms of worship—from
the ancient Iranian prophet. The change from the faith
of Peter to that of St. Augustine is not greater than that from
the faith of Zarathustra's rude disciples to that of the subtle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508"> 508</span>
self-conscious priests who composed these later formularies, or
the laity who accepted them. Still, after all has been said,
after it has been freely admitted that subsequent speculation,
or imagination, or the influence of neighboring creeds, introduced
a host of minor spirits or quasi-gods, of whom Zarathustra
knew nothing, it must also be emphatically asserted that
the God of Zarathustra never loses, among the multitude of his
associates, either his supremacy or his unique and transcendent
attributes. While in the Gâthâs Ahura-Mazda alone is worshiped;
while in the later chapters of the Yaçna many other
personages receive a more or less limited homage along with
him; while in the Yashts these personages are singled out one
after another for what appears unbounded adoration,—the
original God invariably maintains his rank as the Creator; the
one Supreme Lord of mankind, as of all his creatures; the
instructor of Zarathustra; the Being compared to whom all
others stand related as the thing made towards its Maker.
Theism does not in the Avesta pass into polytheism. Strictly
speaking, its spirit is monotheistic throughout, though we might
often be betrayed into thinking the contrary by the extravagance
of its language. Nor can I discover in its pages the doctrine
which some have held to be contained in it, namely, that
above Ahura-Mazda, somewhere in the dark background of the
universe, was a God still greater than him, the ultimate Power
to which even he must yield, Zrvâna-Akarana, or Infinite Time.
The very name of this highly abstract being appears but rarely
in the Avesta, and never, so far as I am able to discover, in
the character thus assigned to him. Ahura-Mazda remains
throughout the God of Gods; his is the highest and most
sacred name known to his worshipers, and none can compare
with him, the Infinite Creator, in greatness, in glory, or in
power.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that, in the early stage of social
progress at which a great part at least of the Avesta was written,
its moral doctrines should be altogether faultless. Nevertheless,
it may well sustain a comparison in this respect with
the codes which have been received as authoritative by other
nations. Subject to the drawback, common to all theologically-influenced
systems of ethics, of laying as much stress upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509"> 509</span>
correct belief and the diligent performance of the customary
rites as upon the really fundamental duties of men, the Zend-Avesta
upholds a high standard of morality, and honestly seeks
to inculcate upon believers the immense importance of leading
an upright and virtuous life. Such a life alone is pleasing to
God; such a life alone can insure a safe passage over the hazardous
bridge by which the soul must pass to Paradise. Not
only are the more obvious virtues—respect for life, careful
observance of promises, industrious conduct—sedulously enjoined
on the faithful Parsee, but some others, less obvious and
too frequently overlooked, are urged upon them. The seducer
is bound to provide both for the infant he has called into existence,
and for its mother, at least for a certain period. Domestic
animals are not forgotten, and humanity towards these dependent
creatures is commanded in a series of precepts, the spirit of
which would do honor to any age. And, in general, the blamelessness
required in thoughts, words, and works imposed on the
devout Mazdayaçna a comprehensive attention to the many
ways in which he might lapse from virtue, and held before him
an exalted conception of moral purity.</p>

<p>Yet, when all this has been said, it must still be admitted
that the Zend-Avesta hides its light, such as it is, under a
bushel. Such is the number of supra-mundane spirits to be
lauded, such a mass of ceremonies to be attended to, so great
the proportion of space devoted to guarding against legal impurities
as compared with that consigned to preventing moral
evil, that the impression left upon the minds of unbelieving
readers is on the whole far from favorable. Morality has, in
fact, got buried under theology. The trivialities, inanities, and
repetitions that abound in the sacred text draw off the mind
from the occasional excellences of thought and expression which
it contains. Thus he who toils through the verbose Fargards
of the Vendidad, the obscure chapters of the older and younger
Yaçna, or the panegyrical rhapsodies of the Yashts, will find
but little to reward his search. With the Gâthâs indeed it is
otherwise. These are full of interest, and not quite devoid of a
simple grandeur. But as a whole, the Avesta is a mine which,
among vast heaps of rubbish, discloses but here and there a
grain of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_510"> 510</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section VI.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Koran.</span><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></h4>

<p>Alone among the Scriptures of the several great religions,
the Koran is the work of a single author. It is, therefore, characterized
by greater uniformity of style, subject, and doctrine
than the sacred collections of other nations. Considerable as
the difference is between its earlier and its later Suras, a consistent
line of thought is visible throughout, and pious Moslems
are free from the difficulty that has always beset Christian theologians
of "harmonizing" contradictory passages both supposed
to emanate from God. There are, indeed, earlier revelations
inconsistent with later ones; but in this case, the former
are held to have been abrogated by the latter. Mediocre in the
order of its thought, diffuse in style, abundant in repetitions,
there are few books more calculated to task the patience of a
conscientious reader. But we must recollect, in judging it, that
its author did not write it, and very possibly never contemplated
its existence as a complete work. He published it from time to
time as occasion required, much as a modern statesman would
announce his views by means of speeches, pamphlets, or election
addresses.</p>

<p>When a revelation arrived, Mahomet in the first instance
dictated it to his secretary Zayd, who wrote it on palm-leaves or
skins, or tablets of any kind that might be at hand. Of the
remaining Moslems, some took copies, but many more committed
the revelations to memory; the Arab memory being
remarkably retentive. Under the reign of Abu Bekr, the
prophet's successor, Omar, finding that some one who knew a
piece of the Koran had been killed, suggested that the whole
should be collected. The suggestion was adopted, and Abu
Bekr intrusted the work of collection to the secretary Zayd.
The Koran was then put together, not only from the leaves
that had been left by Mahomet, and thrown without any regard
to order into a chest, but also from the fragments, either writ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511"> 511</span>ten
or preserved in the memory, that were contributed by individual
believers. The copy thus made was not published, but
was committed for safe custody to Hafsa, daughter of Omar, and
one of the widows of the prophet. She kept it during the ten
years of her father Omar's caliphate. But as there were no
official and authorized copies of this genuine Koran, it came to
pass that the various missionaries who were sent as teachers to
the newly-conquered countries repeated it differently, and that
various readings crept into the transcripts in use. Hence serious
threatenings of division and scandal among the Moslems.
The caliph Othman, foreseeing the danger, appointed a commission,
with the secretary Zayd at its head, to copy the copy
of Hafsa and return it to her, their duty being to determine on
differences of reading, and to be careful to restore the Meccan
idiom where it had been departed from in any of the versions.
Several copies were made by the commissioners, of which one
was kept at Medina, and the others sent to the great military
stations. This was the official text, prepared about <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 25-30;
and after its establishment, all private copies or fragments of
the Koran were ordered by Othman to be destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The
original Koran, which Mahomet did but reproduce, is supposed
by those who accept it as divine to be preserved in heaven, in
the very presence of its original author, on an enormous table.</p>

<p>In the Koran, as arranged by Zayd, there is apparently no
fixed principle in the order of the Suras or chapters. In the
main, the longest Suras come first, but even this rule is not
adhered to consistently. Of chronological arrangement there is
not a trace, and it has been left to the ingenuity of European
scholars to endeavor to discover approximately the date
of the several revelations. Of some, the occasions of their publication
are known, but in the case of the great majority, nothing
beyond a conjectural arrangement can be attained.</p>

<p>The principal themes with which the Koran is occupied are
the unity of God; his attributes; the several prophets preceding
Mahomet, whom he has sent to convert unbelievers; the
joys of Paradise and the terrors of hell; and the legislative
edicts promulgated for the government of the Arabs under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512"> 512</span>
new religion. Of these several subjects, the first two occupy a
predominant place in the earliest revelations. Legends of
prophets, of whom Mahomet recognized a considerable number,
form one of the standing dishes set before the faithful during
all but the very beginning of his career. He was also fond of
speaking of the contrast between the position of believers and
skeptics in a future state; but he seems at first to have expected
a temporal judgment on his Meccan opponents, and afterwards
to have been contented with awaiting the divine vengeance in
another world. Legislation, of course, belongs only to that portion
of the Koran which was revealed after the Hegira.</p>

<p>A few specimens will be quite sufficient to give a notion both
of the earlier and later style of this sacred volume. Here is a
Sura revealed at Mecca during the first struggles of the prophet's
mind, when it was completely possessed with the awfulness
of the new truth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O thou enfolded in thy mantle, stand up all night, except a small
portion of it, for prayer. Half; or curtail the half a little,—or add to it:
and with measured tone intone the Koran, for we shall devolve on thee
weighty words. Verily, at the coming of night are <i>devout</i> (Italics, here
and elsewhere, in Rodwell) impressions strongest, and words are most
collected; but in the daytime thou hast continual employ—and commemorate
the name of thy Lord, and devote thyself to him with entire
devotion.... Of a truth, thy Lord knoweth that thou prayest
almost two-thirds, or half, or a third of the night, as do a part of thy
followers" (K., p. 7.—Sura, 73).</p>
</div>

<p>This is the opening Sura of the Koran:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds! the compassionate! the
merciful! King on the day of reckoning! Thee <i>only</i> do we worship, and
to thee do we cry for help. Guide thou us on the straight path, the
path of those to whom thou hast been gracious; with whom thou art not
angry, and who go not astray" (K., p. 11.—Sura, 1).</p>
</div>

<p>In the Sura now to be quoted we find an allusion to one of
the prophets whom Mahomet regarded as precursors—the
prophet Saleh, who had sent them to a people called Themoud
to bid them worship God. The legend associated with his name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513"> 513</span>
is, that he appealed to a she-camel as a proof of his divine
mission, commanding the people to let her go at large and do
her no hurt. Some of the Themoudites believed; but they were
ridiculed by the skeptical chiefs of the nation, whose wickedness
went so far as actually to hamstring the apostolic camel. Hereupon
an earthquake overtook them by night, and they were all
found dead in the morning (K., p. 376.—Sura, 7. 71-77). Such
things were Mahomet's stock-in-trade; and the following Sura
exemplifies the mixture of his early poetic thoughts with the
prosaic narratives which did duty so constantly during the
maturity of his apostleship:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"By the Sun and his noonday brightness! by the Moon when she
followeth him! by the Day when it revealeth his glory! by the Night
when it enshroudeth him! by the Heaven and him who built it! by the
Earth and him who spread it forth! by a Soul and him who balanced it,
and breathed into it its wickedness and its piety! blessed now is he who
hath kept it pure, and undone is he who hath corrupted it!</p>

<p>"Themoud in his impiety rejected the message of the Lord, when
the greatest wretch among them rushed up:—Said the apostle of God to
them,—The camel of God! let her drink. But they treated him as an
imposter and hamstrung her. So their Lord destroyed them for their
crime, and visited all alike: nor feared he the issue" (K., p. 24.—Sura, 91).</p>
</div>

<p>The same Sura which contains the history of Saleh, prophet
of Themoud, refers also to various other divine messengers who
had fulfilled the same office of announcing the judgments of
God. Mahomet's general view of the prophetic function seems
to be expressed in these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Every nation hath its set time. And when their time is come they
shall not retard it an hour; and they shall not advance it. O children
of Adam! there shall come to you Apostles from among yourselves,
rehearsing my signs to you; and whoso shall fear God and do good
works, no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they be put to grief.
But they who charge our signs with falsehood, and turn away from them
in their pride, shall be inmates of the fire; for ever shall they abide
therein" (K., p. 371.—Sura, 7. 32-34).</p>
</div>

<p>The prophets whom he mentions in this Sura are Noah, who
was sent to warn his people of the Deluge; Houd, sent to Ad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514"> 514</span>
an unbelieving nation whom God cut off, with the exception of
those who had accepted Houd; Saleh, sent to Themoud as
above related; Lot, sent to Sodom to warn it against sin;
Shoaib, sent to Madian, a people of which the unbelieving
members were destroyed by earthquakes; Moses, sent with
signs to Pharaoh and his nobles, as also to the Israelites, of
whom some worshiped the calf, and were overtaken by the
wrath of their Lord (K., p. 375-386.—Sura, 7. 57-154). In another
Sura he makes mention of other prophets besides these: namely,
of John the Baptist, Jesus of Nazareth, Abraham, Ishmael, and
Enoch (K., p. 127 ff.—Sura, 19).</p>

<p>His view of Jesus Christ is peculiar and interesting. He invariably
treats him with the highest respect as a servant of
God and his own precursor, but he is careful to protest that the
opinion of his divinity was not held by Jesus, and was a baseless
invention of his followers. The notion that God could have
a son seems to him a gross profanation, and he often recurs to
it in terms of the strongest reprobation. Thus he endeavors to
claim Christ as a genuine Moslem, and to include Christianity
within the pale of the new faith. A Christian who adopted it
might continue, indeed must continue, to believe everything in
the Old and New Testaments, except such passages as expressly
assert the incarnation and divinity of Jesus. Yet Mahomet's
own version of this prophet's conception involves a supernatural
element, and only differs from that of Luke in not asserting the
paternity of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And make mention in the Book," he says, "of Mary when
she went apart from her family, eastward, and took a veil <i>to
shroud herself</i> from them, and we sent our spirit to her, and he
took before her the form of a perfect man. She said: 'I fly for
refuge from thee to the God of Mercy! If thou fearest him
<i>begone from me</i>.' He said: 'I am only a messenger of thy
Lord, that I may bestow on thee a holy son.' She said: 'How
shall I have a son, when man hath never touched me, and I am
not unchaste.' He said: 'So shall it be. Thy Lord hath said:
easy is this with me, and we will make him a sign to mankind
and a mercy from us. For it is a thing decreed.' And she conceived
him, and retired with him to a far-off place" (K., p. 128.—Sura,
19. 16-22).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_515"> 515</span></p>

<p>Her virginity is expressly asserted in another place, where
she is described as "Mary, the daughter of Imran, who kept
her maidenhood, and into whose womb we breathed of our
spirit."<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>When the child was born the woman was accused of unchastity,
but the infant prophet at once opened his mouth and
declared his prophetic character. From this narrative it appears
that, in Mahomet's opinion, Jesus was neither begotten by a
human father, nor was the son of God. He finds a <i>via media</i> in
the doctrine that he was created, like Adam, by an express exertion
of the power of the Almighty. "He created him of dust:
He then said to him, 'Be,' and he was" (K., p. 502.—Sura, 3. 52).
And again, in the Sura above quoted: "It beseemeth not God
to beget a son, Glory be to him! when he decreeth a thing, he
only saith to it, Be, and it is" (K., p. 130.—Sura, 19. 36).</p>

<p>He is very indignant against those who hold the doctrine of
the incarnation, which he apparently considers as equivalent to
that of physical generation by the Deity, and which, under any
aspect, is certainly shocking to a genuine monotheist.</p>

<p>"They say: 'The God of Mercy hath gotten offspring.' Now
have ye done a monstrous thing! Almost might the very heavens
be rent thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, and the
mountains fall down in fragments, that they ascribe a son to the
God of Mercy, when it beseemeth not the God of Mercy to
beget a son!" (K., p. 135.—Sura, 19. 91-93.) "And they say,
'God hath a son:' No! Praise be to him! But his whatever is
in the heavens and the earth! All obeyeth him, sole Maker of
the heavens and of the earth! and when he decreeth a thing he
only saith to it, Be, and it is" (K., p. 445.—Sura, 2. 110-111).</p>

<p>Mahomet's conception of his own character is most clearly
expressed in the seventh Sura, where, after enumerating some
of the prophets who had gone before him (as already related),
he proceeds to describe a supposed dialogue between Moses and
God, in which the Deity speaks thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My chastisement shall fall on whom I will, and my mercy embraceth
all things, and I write it down for those who shall fear me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516"> 516</span>
pay the alms, and believe in our signs, who shall follow the Apostle, the
unlettered Prophet—whom they shall find described with them in the
Law and Evangel. What is right will he enjoin them, and forbid them
what is wrong, and will allow them healthful viands and prohibit the
impure, and will ease them of their burden, and of the yokes which
were upon them; and those who shall believe in him, and strengthen
him, and help him, and follow the light which hath been sent down with
him,—these are they with whom it shall be well."</p>
</div>

<p>The revelation to Moses now ceases, and God continues to
address Mahomet with the usual preliminary "say:"—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Say to them: O men! Verily I am God's apostle to you all: whose
is the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! There is no God but
he! He maketh alive and killeth! Therefore believe in God and his
apostle—the unlettered Prophet—who believeth in God and his word.
And follow him that ye may be guided aright" (K., p. 386.—Sura, 7.
155-158).</p>
</div>

<p>Mahomet liked to describe himself as unlettered, and thus to
obtain for the scriptural knowledge and literary skill displayed
in the Koran the credit of its being due to inspiration.</p>

<p>In another place he again describes his prophetic character
in the following strain:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Muhammed is not the father of any man among you, but he is the
Apostle of God and the seal of the prophets: and God knoweth all
things.... O Prophet! we have sent thee to be a witness, and a
herald of glad tidings, and a warner; and one who, through his own permission,
summoneth to God, and a light-giving torch" (K., p. 567.—Sura,
33, 40, 44, 45).</p>
</div>

<p>A conspicuous feature of the Koran to which allusion has
not yet been made is its frequent reference to the pleasures of
Paradise to be enjoyed by the faithful, and the pains of hell to
be suffered by the infidels. The day of judgment is continually
held out as an encouragement to the former, and a terror to
the latter. The fifty-sixth Sura contains a description of heaven
which is enough to make the mouth of good Moslems water.
"The people of the right hand" are to be happy; those of the
left hand, wretched. The former are to have "gardens of de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517"> 517</span>light,"
with "inwrought couches," whereon reclining, "aye-blooming
youths" are to bring them "flowing wine" of the
best celestial vintage. They are to enjoy their favorite fruits,
and to eat whatever birds they long for. "Houris with large
dark eyes," and "ever virgins," never growing old, are to supply
them with the pleasures of love, so strangely overlooked in
the Christian pictures of heavenly life. On the other side, we
have "the people of the left hand," who are to be tormented
with "pestilential winds" and "scalding water," and are to
live "in the shadow of a black smoke," with the fruit of a bitter
tree to eat and boiling water to drink (K., p. 60.—Sura, 56).
The prophet delights in warning his enemies of their coming
fate. "Verily," says God in another place, "we have got ready
the flame for the infidel" (K., p. 598.—Sura, 48. 13). "O
Prophet!" we read elsewhere, "make war on the infidels and
hypocrites, and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their
abode! and wretched the passage to it!" (K., p. 606.—Sura, 66.
9). "God promiseth the hypocritical men and women, and the
unbelievers, the fire of hell—therein shall they abide—this
their sufficing portion!" (K., p. 621.—Sura, 9. 69). Some, who
had declined to march with the Prophet from Medina on account
of the heat, are sternly reminded that "a fiercer heat will be
the fire of hell" (K., p. 623.—Sura, 9. 82).</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the deplorable state of the hypocrites
and unbelievers—blind in this world and destined to suffer
eternally in the next—we have a pleasing picture of the condition
of the faithful Moslems:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Muhammed is the apostle of God; and his comrades are vehement
against the infidels, <i>but</i> full of tenderness among themselves. Thou
mayst see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, imploring favors
from God, and his acceptance. Their tokens are on their faces, the
marks of their prostrations. This is their picture in the Law and their
picture in the Evangel; they are as the seed which putteth forth its
stalk; then strengtheneth it, and it groweth stout, and riseth upon its
stem, rejoicing the husbandman—that the infidels may be wrathful at
them. To such of them as believe and do the things that are right, hath
God promised forgiveness and a noble recompense" (K., p. 601.—Sura,
48. 29).</p>
</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Section VII.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Old Testament.</span></h4>

<p>Before entering upon the comparative examination of the
Hebrew Canon, it is necessary to say a few words of the extraordinary
race who were its authors. There is probably no other
book of which it may be said, with the same depth and fulness
of meaning, that it is the work of a nation and the reflection
of a nation's life. The history of the Bible and the history of
the Jews are more intimately bound up together than is that
of any other nation with that of any other book. During the
period of their political existence as a separate people they
wrote the Canon. During the long period of political annihilation
which has succeeded, they have not ceased to write commentaries
on the Canon. This one great production has filled
the imaginations, has influenced the intellect, has fed the religious
ardor of each succeeding generation of Jews. To name
the canonical Scriptures, and the endless series of writings suggested
by them or based upon them, would be almost to sum
up the results of the literary activity of the Hebrew race.</p>

<p>Our first historical acquaintance with the Hebrews brings
them before us as obtaining by conquest, and then inhabiting,
that narrow strip of territory bordering the Mediterranean Sea
which is known as Palestine. Their own legends, indeed, carry
us back to a still earlier period, when they lived as slaves in
Egypt; but on these, from the character of the narrative, very
little reliance can be placed. The story, gradually becoming
less and less mythical, tells us, what is probably true, that
they overcame the native inhabitants of Palestine in war, and
seized upon their land; that they then passed through an anarchial
period, during which the centre of authority seems to
have been lost, and the national unity was in no small danger
of being destroyed, had not vigorous and able leaders interposed
to save it; that, under the pressure of these circumstances, they
adopted a monarchial constitution, by which the dangers of this
time of anarchy were at least to a large extent averted, and the
discordant elements brought into subjection to a common centre.
Thus united, the Jewish monarchy rapidly attained a considerable
height of splendor and of power. Surrounding nations fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519"> 519</span>
under its sway, and it took rank as one of the great powers
which divided Western Asia. But this glory was not to last
long. The monarchy, broken up into two hostile parts by the
folly of Rehoboam, lost alike its unity and its strength; and
after a long series of kings, whom it is needless to enumerate,
both its branches fell victims, at separate times, the one to
Shalmaneser, king of the Assyrians, the other to Nebuchadnezzar,
king of the Chaldees. The latter event, while it put an end
to the very existence of the Jewish nation as an independent
political power—for it was but a fitful independence which was
recovered under the Asmoneans—marks an epoch which severs
the history of the Jews into two periods, distinguished from one
another by the completely different character borne by the people
in each. It is customary, for theological purposes, to represent
the religious development of the Jews as pervaded by a
fundamental unity. They are supposed to have known and
worshiped the true God from the beginning, to have been
sharply marked off from the rest of the world by their strict
monotheism, and to have been unfaithful to their inherited
creed only when they refused to recognize Christ and his apostles
as its authorized interpreters. Their own records tell a
very different story. According to these, the religion of the
Jews, like that of other nations, progressed, changed, improved,
underwent purification and alteration, and was, in its earlier
forms, not much unlike that of the surrounding heathens. Their
leaders, indeed, and all those whom their Scriptures uphold as
examples of excellence, worshiped a national God, Jehovah,
whom they may have considered the only god who enjoyed
actual existence and possessed actual power. But whether or
not this were the case, he was, for all practical purposes, simply
the tutelary deity of the Hebrews. In his name the conquerors
of Palestine pillaged, murdered, and inflicted cruelties on the
vanquished; to him they looked for aid in their belligerent
undertakings; to him they offered the first fruits of victory.
It was under his direct leadership that they professed to subdue
the heathens, and to attain national security. The ark was his
dwelling, and it could only bring destruction to the Philistines,
who were not under the protection of its inmate. And when
the Jews asked to be placed under the rule of a monarch, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520"> 520</span>
were told by the mouthpiece of Jehovah that it was his divine
government which they were rejecting. The morality of the
chiefs who conducted the invasion and subjugation of Palestine
was not one whit superior to that of their enemies, nor was the
god on whose power they relied of an essentially higher nature
than many other national or local divinities who were worshiped
by other nations. They were the rude leaders of a rude people
worshiping a rude deity. His character was such as we might
expect the tutelary divinity of a tribe of wandering and unsettled
Bedouins to be. Having to establish their right to a permanent
home and an organized government by force of arms,
it was only natural that they should represent their God as
favoring the exploits of those arms, and even urging them on
to the most ruthless exercise of the rights of conquerors. It
was natural that even their most revolting acts should be placed
under the especial patronage of this approving god. It was
natural, too, that when the conquest had been at least in great
part effected, while yet the anarchial and semi-savage condition
of the victors continued (as it did more or less until after the
accession of David), and internal strife took the place of external
warfare, the national god should become to some extent a
party-god; should favor one section against another, and even
excite the ferocious passion of those to whose side he inclined.
The god of Moses, of Joshua, and the Judges was thus a passionate,
relentless, and cruel partisan. No doubt the facts were
not precisely such as they are represented to us by the writers
in the Old Testament, since in the internecine conflicts which
occasionally broke forth we may assume that each side claimed
for itself the approbation of Jehovah. But still the story of the
Hebrew annals is clear enough to show us the semi-savage
character of the people in these early days, and their utter
failure to form that lofty conception of the deity with which
they have been so largely credited by believers in the supernatural
inspiration of their historical records.</p>

<p>The primitive conception entertained at this period, which
corresponded with that generally found among uncivilized
nations, was improved and elevated to some extent during the
age of comparatively settled government which succeeded. As
the Israelites advanced in the practice of the arts, in the pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521"> 521</span>session
of wealth, in the cultivation of the literary or musical
attainments that refine domestic life, in the peaceful organization
of a society that had become more industrial and less warlike,
their idea of Jehovah underwent the modifications which
these changes imply. The god of Samuel is widely different
from the god of Isaiah or Jeremiah. Whether the popular
notion had risen to the height attained by these prophets may
indeed be doubted; but this too must have altered in order to
make such prophets possible. Yet, in spite of the comparative
improvement, there are abundant indications during the kingly
period that the old Hebrew deity still retained the ferocious
characteristics by which he had formerly been distinguished.
Elijah's patron is gracious enough to his own adherents, but
the attributes of mercy or gentleness towards human beings
generally are undiscoverable in his character. And the deeds of
blood which pious monarchs from time to time were guilty of
in his honor, and which received his approbation, show that if
the process of his civilization had begun, it was still very far
from being completed.</p>

<p>But the special glory of the Jewish race is supposed to consist
even more in the fact that this God, such as he was, stood
alone, than in the excellence of the manner in which they conceived
of his nature. The constancy of their monotheism, amid
the polytheism of surrounding nations, has appeared to subsequent
generations so marvelous as to require a revelation to
account for it. The facts, however, as related to us by the Jews
themselves, do not warrant the supposition that monotheism
actually was the creed of the people until after the Captivity.
It appears, indeed, that that form of belief was held by those
who are depicted to us as the most eminent and the most virtuous
among them, and it would seem that there was generally
a considerable party who adhered to the worship of Jehovah,
and at times succeeded in forcing it upon the nation at large.
But that Jehovism was the authorized and established national
religion, and that every other form and variety of faith was an
authorized innovation, is a far wider conclusion than the facts
will warrant us in drawing. This, no doubt, and nothing less
than this, is the contention of the historical writers of the Old
Testament; but even their own statements, made as they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522"> 522</span>
under the influence of the strongest Jehovistic bias, point with
tolerable clearness to a different conclusion. They inform us
that while the most ancient leaders of the Israelites who conducted
them to the promised land, the distinguished Judges who
from time to time arose, and all the most virtuous kings,
belonged to the religion of Jehovah, the people, notwithstanding
these great examples, were continually guilty of relapses into
idolatry of the most flagrant kind. This tendency manifested
itself so early, and reappeared with such persistence during the
whole history of the Israelites of both branches up to the
destruction of their respective monarchies, that we cannot, consistently
with the admitted facts, suppose that Jehovism had at
any time taken very deep root in the mind of the people. They
seem, on the contrary, to have been readily swayed to and fro
by the example of the reigning monarch. Whether indeed they
sincerely adopted monotheism under a monotheistic sovereign,
may perhaps be doubted; but the emphatic denunciations of the
Biblical writers leave us no room to question the perfect sincerity
of their idolatry. All therefore that we can be justified
in inferring from what they tell us is, that a succession of
priests and prophets maintained the faith of Jehovah from age
to age, and that from time to time a sovereign arose who
favored their views, and did all in his power, sometimes by fair
means and not unfrequently by foul, to advance the interests
of the Jehovistic party. Indian history acquaints us with very
similar fluctuations in the religion of a province, according as
the priests of one or the other contending sect succeeded in
obtaining influence over the mind of the reigning Rajah. But
although we maintain that monotheism was not, previous to
the captivity, the popular religion of the Jews, we need not go
the length of asserting that there was no difference in their
minds between Jehovah and the other deities whom they
adopted from surrounding nations. Jehovah was unquestionably
the national god, who was held to extend a peculiar protection
over the Hebrew race. Nor does it follow that those who
betook themselves to some idolatrous <i>cultus</i> necessarily abandoned
that of Jehovah. Both might well have been carried on
together, and there is abundant evidence that the Jews of this
period had much of that elasticity which characterizes polythe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523"> 523</span>ism,
and makes it ever ready to add new members to its pantheon
without discarding old favorites. So far as there was a
national worship carried on by a national priesthood, Jehovah
must have been its object. But we are not therefore compelled
to imagine that the nation had adopted Jehovism in so solemn
and binding a manner as to render its abandonment a gross
violation of their fundamental institutions. No doubt, according
to the Scriptural writers, it was a deliberate breach of the original
constitution to forsake, even for a moment, the exclusive
service of the national god for that of any other deity whatsoever.
But the supernatural origin assigned by them to this
original constitution throws a doubt on their assertions, while
the facts they report serve to increase it. For while we learn
that Jehovah was deserted by one generation after another in
favor of more popular rivals, much to the indignation of his
priests and prophets, we do not perceive any traces of a consciousness
on the part of the idolaters that they were guilty of
infidelity to fundamental and unchangeable laws. They rather
appear to have acted in mere levity, and the repeated objurgations
of the Jehovistic party would tend to the conclusion that
the people were not aware of any binding obligation to adhere
to the worship of this deity to the exclusion of that of every
other. The efforts of the Jehovists may indeed show that <i>they</i>
believed such an obligation to exist: but not that their opponents
were equally aware of it. Moreover, we are not without
some more positive testimony which strongly favors this view
of their mutual relations. Under the reign of the pious, and no
doubt credulous, Josiah, a certain priest professed to have discovered
a "book of the law" mysteriously hidden in the temple.
Without discussing in this place what book this may have
been, it is plain that it inculcated Jehovism under the penalty
of curses similar to those found in Deuteronomy, and it is plain
too that its contents caused the monarch a painful surprise,
which expressed itself by his rending his clothes and sending a
commission to "inquire of the Lord" "concerning the words
of this book that is found." Now is it possible to suppose that
the words of such a book as this could have inflicted on Josiah
so great a shock, or have required the appointment of a special
commission to inquire concerning them, if it had been a mat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524"> 524</span>ter
of familiar and general knowledge among the Jews that
their forefathers had solemnly adopted Jehovism as the only
lawful national creed, invoking upon themselves those very
curses which the most devout of monarchs was now unable to
hear without astonishment and alarm? And how are we to explain
the production of this book by the priests as a new discovery?
If it had been merely the re-discovery of a lost volume
would the language of the narrative have been at all appropriate?
Must not Josiah in that case have rejoiced at the restoration
to Judah of so precious a treasure, however much he
might have regretted the failure of the nation to observe its
precepts? The difficulty of supposing such facts to have been
forgotten is equally great. It would be scarcely possible to imagine
that not only the people, but the priests, could at any
period have lost all memory of the fact that they were bound,
under the most terrible penalties, to adhere to the faith of Jehovah.
At least the spiritual advisers of so religious a monarch
must have been well aware that their own creed formed an
essential part of the Jewish constitution; and we cannot doubt
that they would carefully have impressed this fact on their willing
pupil, not as a startling disclosure made only after he had
been seventeen years on the throne and had attained the age of
twenty-five, but as one of his earliest and most familiar lessons.
In fact, this sudden discovery, in some secret recess of the temple,
of a hitherto unknown volume, concerning whose claims to
authority or antiquity the writers preserve a mysterious silence,
rather suggests the notion of a Jehovistic <i>coup d'état</i>, prepared
by the zeal of Hilkiah the priest and Shaphan the scribe. A
long time had passed since the accession of the king. His
favorable dispositions were well known. Since the eighth year
of his reign at least he had been under the influence of the
priests, and in the twelfth he had entered (no doubt under their
directions) upon that career of persecuting violence which was
usual with pious monarchs in Judea.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> His mind was undoubtedly
predisposed to receive with implicit confidence any statements
they might make. Hence, if Hilkiah and his associates
had conceived the idea of compiling, from materials at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525"> 525</span>
command, a book which, while recapitulating some events in the
ancient history of Israel, should represent those events in a
light favorable to their designs, they could hardly have chosen
a better moment for the execution of such a scheme. That they
actually did this, it would be going beyond the evidence in our
possession to assert. It may be that the book was an old one;
and in any case, it is unnecessary to suppose that it was an
original composition of Hilkiah's, palmed off upon the king as
ancient. All that appears to me clearly to follow from the
terms of the narrative is, that the law which this book contained
(evidently the law of Jehovah) had not hitherto been
regarded as the established law of the country, and that the
production of this volume, in which its claims to that dignity
were emphatically asserted, and its violation represented as entailing
the most grevious curses, was one of the plans taken by
the priestly party to procure for it the recognition of that
supremacy which they declared it had actually enjoyed in the
days of their forefathers. But although the history of Israel
has been written by adherents of this party, and we are unfortunately
precluded from checking their statements by any document
recounting the same events from the point of view of
their opponents, their records, biased as they are, clearly show
us a nation whose favorite and ordinary creed was not monotheism;
which was ever ready to adopt with fervor the idolatrous
practices of its neighbors; and which was not converted
to pure and exclusive monotheism till after the terrible lesson
of the Captivity in Babylon.</p>

<p>This great event was turned to excellent account by the
priests and prophets of Jehovah. Instead of regarding it as a
natural consequence of the political relations of Judea with
more powerful empires, they represented it as the fulfillment of
the penalties threatened by Jehovah for infidelity towards himself.
And as this view offered a plausible explanation of their
unparalleled misfortunes, it was naturally accepted by many as
the true solution of sufferings so difficult to reconcile with the
protection supposed to be accorded by their national god. Under
these circumstances a double process went on during their
compulsory residence in heathendom. Great numbers, who
were either not Jehovists, or whose Jehovism was but lukewarm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526"> 526</span>
gradually adapted themselves to their situation among idolaters,
and became at length indistinguishably fused, as the ten scribes
had been, with the alien races. But a few remained faithful to
their God. These few it was who formed the whole of the
nation which, when return was possible, returned to their native
soil. Those who were not inspired by a deep sense of the sanctity
of their national religion; those to whom the restoration
of their national rites was not the one object of overwhelming
importance; those whose hopes of national restoration were of
a temporal rather than a spiritual nature, had no sufficient
motive to return to their native soil. Jerusalem could have no
attractions for them which Babylon did not possess. Thus, by
a natural process, the most ardent, the most spiritual, the most
unbending monotheists were weeded out from the mass of the
community, and it was they who accompanied Zerubbabel or
Ezra on his sacred mission. Misfortune, which had not shaken
their faith, had deepened and purified it. Not only were they
Jehovists, but they were Jehovists of the sternest type. There
was among them none of that admixture of levity, and none of
that facile adaptability to foreign rites, which characterized the
oldest Jews. From this time forward their monotheism has
never been broken by a single relapse.</p>

<p>Thus the Captivity forms the turning-point in the character
of the Jews; for, in fact, the nation which was conquered by
Nebuchadnezzar was not the nation which, in the days of Kyros
and Artaxerxes returned to re-colonize and rebuild Jerusalem.
The conquered people belonged to a monarchy which, if it was
now feeble and sunken, was directly descended from one which
had been glorious and mighty, and which had aimed at preserving
for Judea the status and dignity of an independent power.
Under its influence the Jews had been mobile, idolatrous, deaf
to the voice of Jehovistic prophets, neglectful of Jehovistic
rites; desirous of conquest, and, when that was impossible, unwilling
on political grounds to submit to foreign domination;
rude if not semi-barbarous in morals, and distracted by the
contention of rival religious parties. But this polity, of which
the ruling motives were mainly political, was succeeded after
the return of the exiles by a polity of which the ruling motives
were exclusively religious. All were now adherents of Jehovah;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527"> 527</span>
all were zealous performers of the rites conceived to be his due.</p>

<p>This change must be borne in mind if we would understand
Jewish history; for the same language is not applicable to the
Jews before and after the Captivity, nor can we regard in the
same light a struggling and feeble race upholding its unanimous
faith in the midst of trials, and an independent nation in
which a party, from time to time victorious, endeavors to impose
that faith by force. We may without inconsistency censure the
violence of the Jehovistic sectaries, and admire the courage of
the Jehovistic people. But although there is much in this
change that is good, it must be admitted that it has its bad
side. While becoming more conscientious, more scrupulously
true to its own principles, and more penetrated with a sense
of religion, Judaism became at the same time more rigid,
more formal, more ritualistic, and more unsocial. Ewald has
remarked that the constitution established after the return from
captivity is one that lays undue stress upon the exterior forms
of religion, and may in time even become hostile to what is
truly holy. As it claims to be in possession of something holy
which temporal governments do not possess, it cannot submit
to their dominion; hence, he observes, Israel could never become
an independent nation again under this constitution.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Nor was this all. Even apart from its tendency to magnify
external forms, which was perhaps not of its essence, the
religion of Jehovah had inherent vices. The Jews, believing
their god to be the only true one, and insisting above all on
the supreme importance of preserving the purity of his <i>cultus</i>,
were necessarily led to assume a haughty and exclusive attitude
towards all other nations, which could not fail to provoke their
hostility. This unloveable spirit was shown immediately after
their return by their contumelious rejection of the Sâmaritan
proposals to aid in building the temple—proposals which seem
to have been made in good faith; by the Sabbatarian legislation
of Nehemiah; and even more by the exclusively harsh measures
taken by Ezra for the purification of the race. It was
simply inevitable that all heathen nations who came in contact
with them should hate a people who acted on such principles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528"> 528</span>
Nor were the fears of the heathen altogether without foundation.
When the Jews recovered a temporary independence under
the Maccabees, their intolerance, now able to vent itself in acts
of conquest, became a source of serious danger. Thus, John
Hyrcanus destroyed the temple of the Sâmaritans (who also
worshiped Jehovah) on Mount Gerizim, and the Jews actually
commemorated the event by a semi-festival. Alexander Jannasus,
too, carried on wars of conquest against his neighbors. In
one of these he took the town of Gaza, and evinced the treatment
to be expected from him by letting loose his army on the
inhabitants and utterly destroying their city. It was no doubt
their unsocial and proud behavior towards all who were not
Jews that provoked the heathens to try their temper by so
many insults directed to the sensitive point—their religion.
Culpable as this was, it must be admitted that it was in some
degree the excessive scrupulosity of the Jews in regard to things
indifferent in themselves that exposed them to so much annoyance.
Had they been content to permit the existence of Hellenic
or Roman customs side by side with theirs, they might have
been spared the miseries which they subsequently endured.
But the Scriptures, from beginning to end, breathed a spirit of
fierce and exclusive attachment to Jehovah; he was the only
deity; all other objects of adoration were an abomination in
his sight. Penetrated with this spirit, the Jews patiently submitted
to the yoke of every succeeding authority—Chaldeans,
Syrians, Egyptians, Romans—until the stranger presumed to
tamper with the national religion. Then their resistance was
fierce and obstinate. The great rebellion which broke out in
the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, under the leadership of Mattathias,
was provoked by the attempt of that monarch to force
Greek institutions on the Jewish people. The glorious dynasty
of the Asmoneans were priests as well as kings, and the royal
office, indeed, was only assumed by them in the generation
after that in which they had borne the priestly office, and as a
consequence of the authority derived therefrom. Under the
semi-foreign family of the Herods, who supplanted the Asmoneans,
and ruled under Roman patronage, as afterwards under
the direct government of Rome, it was nothing but actual or
suspected aggressions against the national faith that provoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529"> 529</span>
the loudest murmurs or the most determined opposition. It
was this faith which had upheld the Jews in their heroic revolt
against Syrian innovations. It was this which inspired them to
support every offshoot of the Asmonean family against the
odious Herod. It was this which led them to entreat of Pompey
that he would abstain from the violation of the temple; to
implore Caligula, at the peril of their lives, not to force his
statue upon them; to raise tumults under Cumanus, and finally
to burst the bonds of their allegiance to Rome under Gessius
Florus. It was this which sustained the war that followed upon
that outbreak—a war in which even the unconquerable power
of the Roman Empire quailed before the unrivaled skill and
courage of this indomitable race; a war of which I do not hesitate
to say that it is probably the most wonderful, the most
heroic, and the most daring which an oppressed people has
ever waged against its tyrants.</p>

<p>But against such discipline as that of Rome, and such generals
as Vespasian and Titus, success, however brilliant, could be but
momentary. The Jewish insurrection was quelled in blood, and
the Jewish nationality was extinguished—never to revive. One
more desperate effort was indeed made; once more the best
legions and the best commanders of the Empire were put in
requisition; once more the hopes of the people were inflamed,
this time by the supposed appearance of the Messiah, only to
be doomed again to a still more cruel disappointment. Jerusalem
was razed to the ground; Aelia Capitolina took its place;
and on the soil of Aelia Capitolina no Jew might presume to
trespass. But if the trials imposed on the faith of this devoted
race by the Romans were hard, they were still insignificant
compared to those which it had to bear from the Christian
nations who inherited from them the dominion of Europe. These
nations considered the misfortunes of the Jews as proceeding
from the divine vengeance on the crime they had committed
against Christ; and lest this vengeance should fail to take
effect, they made themselves its willing instruments. No injustice
and no persecution could be too bad for those whom God
himself so evidently hated. Besides, the Jews had a miserable
habit of acquiring wealth; and it was convenient to those who
did not share their ability or their industry to plunder them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530"> 530</span>
from time to time. But the Jewish race and the Jewish religion
survived it all. Tormented, tortured, robbed, put to death,
hunted from clime to clime; outcasts in every land, strangers
in every refuge, the tenacity of their character was proof against
every trial, and superior to every temptation. In this unequal
combat of the strong against the weak, the synagogue has
fairly beaten the Church, and has vindicated for itself that
liberty which during centuries of suffering its enemy refused to
grant. Eighteen hundred years have passed since the soldiers
of Titus burned down the temple, laid Jerusalem in ashes, and
scattered to the winds the remaining inhabitants of Judea; but
the religion of the Jews is unshaken still; it stands unconquered
and unconquerable, whether by the bloodthirsty fury of
the legions of Rome, or by the still more bloodthirsty intolerance
of the ministers of Christ.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision I.</span>—<i>The Historical Books.</i></h5>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that no complete account of
the contents of the Old Testament can be attempted here. To
accomplish anything like a full description of its various parts,
and to discuss the numerous critical questions that must arise
in connection with such a description, would in itself require a
large volume. In a treatise on comparative religion, anything
of this kind would be out of place. It is mainly in its comparative
aspect that we are concerned with the Bible. Hence many
very interesting topics, such, for instance, as the age or authorship
of the several books, must be passed over in silence.
Tempting as it may be to turn aside to such inquiries, they
have no immediate bearing on the subject in hand. Whatever
may be the ultimate verdict of Biblical criticism respecting
them, the conclusions here reached will remain unaffected. All
that I can do is to assume without discussion the results obtained
by the most eminent scholars, in so far as they appear
to me likely to be permanent. That the Book of Genesis, for
example, is not the work of a single writer, but that at least
two hands may be distinguished in it; that the Song of Solomon
is, as explained both by Renan and Ewald, a drama, and not
an effusion of piety; that the latter part of Isaiah is not written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531"> 531</span>
by the same prophet who composed the former,—are conclusions
of criticism which I venture to think may now be taken
for granted and made the basis of further reasoning. At the
same time I have taken for granted—not as certain, but as
likely to be an approximation to the truth—the chronological
arrangement of the prophets proposed by Ewald in his great
work on that portion of Scripture. Further than this, I believe
there are no assumptions of a critical character in the ensuing
pages.</p>

<p>First, then, it is to be observed that the problems which
occupied the writers of the Book of Genesis, and which in their
own fashion they attempted to solve, were the same as those
which in all ages have engaged the attention of thoughtful men,
and which have been dealt with in many other theologies besides
that of the Hebrews. The Hebrew solution may or may
not be superior in simplicity or grandeur to the solutions of
Parsees, Hindus, and others; but the attempt is the same in
character, even if the execution be more successful. The
authors of Genesis endeavor especially to account for:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. <span class="smcap">The Creation of the Universe.</span></li>
<li>2. <span class="smcap">The Origin of Man and Animals.</span></li>
<li>3. <span class="smcap">The Introduction of Evil.</span></li>
<li>4. <span class="smcap">The Diversity of Languages.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>Although the fourth of these questions is, so far as I am
aware, not a common subject of consideration in popular
mythologies, the first three are the standard subjects of primitive
theological speculation. Let us begin with the Creation.</p>

<p>One of the earliest inquiries that human beings address
themselves to when they arrive at the stage of reflection is:—How
did this world in which we find ourselves come into being?
Out of what elements was it formed? Who made it, and in
what way? A natural and obvious reply to such an inquiry is,
that a Being of somewhat similar nature to their own, though
larger and more powerful, took the materials of which the world
is formed and moulded them, as a workman moulds the materials
of his handicraft, into their present shape. The mental
process gone through in reaching this conclusion is simply that
of pursuing a familiar analogy in such a manner as to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532"> 532</span>
the unknown within the range of conceptions applicable to the
known. The solution, as will be seen shortly, contrives to satisfy
one-half of the problem only by leaving the other half out
of consideration. This difficulty, however, does not seem to
have occurred to the ancient Hebrew writers who propounded
the following history of the Creation of the Universe:—</p>

<p>"In the beginning," they say, "God created the heavens
and the earth. And the earth was desolate and waste, and
darkness on the face of the abyss, and the Spirit of God hovering
on the face of the waters. And God said: Let there be
light, and there was light. And God saw the light that it was
good, and God divided between the light and the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
Night. And it was Evening, and it was Morning: one day.</p>

<p>"And God said: Let there be a vault for separation of the
waters, and let it divide between waters and waters." Hereupon
he made the vault, and separated the waters above it from those
below it. The vault he called Heavens. This was his second
day's work. On the third, he separated the dry land from the
sea, "and saw that it was good;" besides which he caused the
earth to bring forth herbs and fruit-trees. "And God said:
Let there be lights in the vault of the heavens to divide between
the day and between the night, and let them be for signs and
for times and for days and for years." Hereupon he made the
sun for the day, the moon for the night, and the stars. "And
God put them on the vault of the heavens to give light to the
earth, and to rule by day and by night, and to separate between
the light and the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
And it was evening, and it was morning; the fourth day" (Gen.
i. 1-19).</p>

<p>Let us pause a moment here before passing on to the next
branch of the subject: the creation of animals and man. The
author had two questions before him; how the materials of the
universe came into being, and how, when in being, they assumed
their present forms and relative positions. Of the first he says
nothing, unless the first verse be taken to refer to it. But this
can scarcely be; for the expression, "God made the heavens
and the earth," cannot easily be supposed to refer to the original
production of the matter out of which the heavens and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533"> 533</span>
earth were subsequently made. Rather must we take it as a
short heading, referring to the creation which is about to be
described. And in any case, the manner in which there came
to be anything at all out of which heavens and earth could be
constructed is not considered. We are left apparently to suppose
that matter is coeval with the Deity; for the author never
faces the question of its origin, which is the real difficulty in
all such cosmogonies as his, but hastens at once to the easier
task of describing the separation and classification of materials
already in existence.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar to the Hebrew legend, both in what it
records and in what it omits, is the story of creation as told by
the Quichés in America:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This is the first word and the first speech. There were neither
men nor brutes, neither birds, fish, nor crabs, stick nor stone, valley nor
mountain, stubble nor forest, nothing but the sky; the face of the land
was hidden. There was naught but the silent sea and the sky. There
was nothing joined, nor any sound, nor thing that stirred; neither any
to do evil, nor to rumble in the heavens, nor a walker on foot; only the
silent waters, only the pacified ocean, only it in its calm. Nothing was
but stillness, and rest, and darkness, and the night; nothing but the
Maker and Moulder, the Hurler, the Bird-Serpent" (M. N. W., p. 196.—Popol
Vuh, p. 7).</p>
</div>

<p>Another cosmogony is derived from the Mixtecs, also aborigines
of America:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the year and in the day of clouds, before ever were either years
or days, the world lay in darkness; all things were orderless, and a
water covered the slime and the ooze that the earth then was" (M. N.
W., p. 196).</p>
</div>

<p>Two winds are in this myth the agents employed to effect
the subsidence of the waters, and the appearance of dry land.
In another account, related by some other tribes, the muskrat
is the instrument which divides the land from the waters. These
myths, as Mr. Brinton, who has collected them, truly remarks,
are "not of a construction, but a reconstruction only, and are
in that respect altogether similar to the creative myth of the
first chapter of Genesis."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534"> 534</span></p>

<p>In the Buddhistic history of the East Mongols, the creation
of the world is made, as in Genesis, the starting point of the
relation. But the creative forces in this mythology are apparently
supposed to be inherent in primeval matter. Hence we
have a Lucretian account of the movements of the several parts
of the component mass without any consideration of the question
how the impulse to these movements was originally given.
"In the beginning there arose the external reservoir from three
different masses of matter; namely, from the creative air, from
the waving water, and from the firm, plastic earth. A strong
wind from ten-quarters now brought about the blue atmosphere.
A large cloud, pouring down continuous rain, formed the sea.
Dry land arose by means of grains of dust collecting on the
surface of the ocean, like cream on milk."<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Although the sacred writings of the Parsees contain no connected
account of the creation, yet this void is fully supplied
by traditions which have acquired a religious sanction, and have
entered into the popular belief. Those traditions are found in
the Bundehesh and the Shahnahmeh, works of high authority
in the Parsee system. According to them, Ahura-Mazda, the
good principle, induced his rival, Agra-Mainyus, the evil principle,
to enter into a truce of nine thousand years, foreseeing
that by means of this interval he would be able to subdue him
in the end. Agra-Mainyus, having discovered his blunder, went
to the darkest hell, and remained there three thousand years.
Ahura-Mazda took advantage of this repose to create the material
world. He produced the sky in forty-five days, the water in
sixty, the earth in seventy-five, the trees in thirty, the cattle in
eighty, and human beings in seventy-five; three hundred and
sixty-five days were thus occupied with the business of creation.
It will be observed that, though the time taken is longer,
the order of production is the same in the Parsee as in the
Hebrew legend. This fact tends to confirm the supposition,
which will hereafter appear still more probable, of an intimate
relation between the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_535"> 535</span></p>

<p>Always prone to speculation, the Hindus were certain to find
in the dark subject of creation abundant materials for their
mystic theories. Various explanations are accordingly given in
the Rig-Veda. Thus, the following account is found in the
tenth Book:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Let us, in chanted hymns, with praise, declare the births of the
gods,—any of us who in this latter age may behold them. Brâhmanaspati
blew forth these births like a blacksmith. In the earliest
age of the gods, the existent sprang from the non-existent: thereafter
the regions sprang from Uttānapad. The earth sprang from Uttānapad,
from the earth sprang the regions: Daksha sprang from Aditi,
and Aditi from Daksha. Then the gods were born, and drew forth the
sun, which was hidden in the ocean" (O. S. T., vol. v. p. 48.—Rig-Veda,
x. 72).</p>
</div>

<p>With higher wisdom, another Vaidik Rishi declares it impossible
to know the origin of the universe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There was then neither nonentity nor entity: there was no atmosphere,
nor sky above. What enveloped [all]? Where, in the receptacle
of what, [was it contained]? Was it water, the profound abyss?
Death was not then, nor immortality; there was no distinction of day
or night. That One breathed calmly, self-supported; there was nothing
different from, or above, it. In the beginning darkness existed, enveloped
in darkness. All this was undistinguishable water. That One
which lay void, and wrapped in nothingness, was developed by the
power of fervor. Desire first arose in It, which was the primal germ of
mind; [and which] sages, searching with their intellect, have discovered
in their heart to be the bond which connects entity with nonentity.
The ray [or cord] which stretched across these [worlds], was it below or
was it above? There were there impregnating powers and mighty
forces, a self-supporting principle beneath, and energy aloft. Who
knows, who here can declare, whence has sprung, whence, this creation?
The gods are subsequent to the development of this [universe];
who then knows whence it arose? From what this creation arose, and
whether [any one] made it or not, he who in the highest heaven is its
ruler, he verily knows, or even he does not know" (O. S. T., vol. v.
p. 356.—Rig-Veda, x. 129).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_536"> 536</span></p>

<p>A later narrative ascribes creation to the god Prajapati, who,
it is said, having the desire to multiply himself, underwent the
requisite austerities, and then produced earth, air, and heaven
(A. B., vol. ii. p. 372).</p>

<p>We now return to Genesis, which proceeds to its second
problem: the creation of living creatures and of man. This is
solved in two distinct fashions by two different writers. The
first relates that on the fifth day God said, "Let the waters
swarm with the swarming of animals having life, and let birds
fly to and fro on the earth, on the face of the vault of the
heavens." Having thus produced the inhabitants of the ocean
and air on the fifth day, he produced those of earth on the
sixth. On this day too he made man in his own image, and
created them male and female. The whole of his work was
now finished, and on the seventh day he enjoyed repose from
his creative exertions, for which reason he blessed the seventh
day (Gen. 1-ii. 3).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here the first account of creation ends; the second begins
with a descriptive title at the fourth verse of the second chapter.
The writer of this version, unlike his predecessor, instead
of ascribing the creation of man to the immediate fiat of
Elohim, describes the process as resembling one of manufacture.
God formed the human figure out of the dust of the earth, and
then blew life into it, a conception drawn from the wide-spread
notion of the identity of breath with life. Again the narrator
of the second story varies from the narrator of the first about
the creation of the sexes. In the first, the male and female are
made together. In the second, a deep sleep falls upon the man,
during which God takes out a rib from his side and makes the
woman out of it. Generally speaking, it may be remarked that
the former writer moves in a more transcendental sphere than
the latter. He likes to conceive the origin of the world, with
all its flora and all its fauna, as arising from the simple power
of the word of God. How they arise he never troubles himself
to say. The latter is more terrestrial. God with him is like a
powerful artist; extremely skilled indeed in dealing with his
materials, but nevertheless obliged to adapt his proceedings to
their nature and capabilities. This author delights in the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537"> 537</span>crete
and particular; and not only does he aim at relating the
order of the creation, but also at making the <i>modus operandi</i>
more or less intelligible to his hearers.</p>

<p>A somewhat different account of the origin of man is given
in the traditions of Samoa, one of the Fiji islands. These traditions
also describe an epoch when the earth was covered with
water. "Tangaloa, the great Polynesian Jupiter," sent his
daughter to find a dry place. After a long time she found a
rock. In subsequent visits she reported that the dry land was
extending. "He then sent her down with some earth and a
creeping plant, as all was barren rock. She continued to visit
the earth and return to the skies. Next visit, the plant was
spreading. Next time, it was withered and decomposing. Next
visit, it swarmed with worms. And the next time, the worms
had become men and women! A strange account of man's
origin!" On which it may be remarked, as a curious psychological
phenomenon, tending to illustrate the effects of habit, that
the missionary considers it "a strange account of man's origin"
which represents God as making him from worms, but readily
accepts another in which he is made out of dust.</p>

<p>The third question dealt with in Genesis is that of the origin
of evil. This is a problem which has engaged the attention and
perplexed the minds of many inquirers besides these ancient
Hebrews, and for which most religions provide some kind of
solution. The manner in which it is treated here is as follows:—</p>

<p>When God made Adam, he placed him in a garden full of
delights, and especially distinguished by the excellence of its
fruit-trees. There was one of these trees, however, the fruit of
which he did not wish Adam to eat. He accordingly gave him
strict orders on the subject in these words: "Of every tree of
the garden thou mayst eat; but of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil, of that thou mayst not eat, for on what day thou
eatest thereof, thou diest the death" (Gen. ii. 16, 17). This
order we must suppose to have been imparted by Adam to Eve,
who was not produced until after it had been given. At any
rate, we find her fully cognizant of it in the ensuing chapter,
where the serpent appears upon the scene and endeavors, only
too successfully, to induce her to eat the fruit. After yielding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538"> 538</span>
to the temptation herself, she induced her husband to do the
like; whereupon both recognized the hitherto unnoticed fact of
their nudity, and made themselves aprons of fig-leaves. Shortly
after this crisis in their lives God came down to enjoy the cool
of the evening in the garden; and Adam and Eve, feeling their
guilt, ran to hide themselves among the trees. God called
Adam, and the latter replied that he had hidden himself
because he was naked. But God at once asked who had told
him he was naked. Had he eaten of the forbidden tree? Of
course Adam and Eve had to confess, and God then cursed the
serpent for his gross misconduct, and punished the man by imposing
labor upon him, and the woman by rendering her liable
to the pains of childbirth. He also condescended so far as to
become the first tailor, making garments of skins for Adam and
Eve. But though he had thus far got the better of them by
his superior strength, he was not without apprehension that
they might outwit him still. "And God, the Everlasting,
spoke: See, the man is become as one of us, to know good and
evil; and now, lest he should stretch out his hand and take also
of the tree of life, and eat and live forever! Therefore God, the
Everlasting, sent him out of the garden of Eden, to cultivate
the ground from which he had been taken" (Gen. iii. 22, 23).
And in order to make quite sure that the man should not get
hold of the tree of life, a calamity which would have defeated
his intention to make him mortal, he guarded the approach to
it by means of Cherubim, posted as sentinels with the flame of
a sword that turned about. In this way he conceived that he
had secured himself against any invasion of his privilege of
immortality on the part of the human race.</p>

<p>Like the myth of creation, the myth of a happier and
brighter age, when men did not suffer from any of the evils
that oppress them now, is common, if not universal. Common
too, if not equally common, is the notion that they fell from
that superior state by contracting the stain of sin. I need
scarcely refer to the classical story of a golden age, embodied
by Hesiod in his "Works and Days," nor to the fable of Pandora
allowing the ills enclosed in the box to escape into the
world. But it may be of interest to remark, that the conception
of a Paradise was no less familiar to the natives of Amer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539"> 539</span>ica
than to those of Europe. "When Christopher Columbus,"
observes Brinton, "fired by the hope of discovering this terrestrial
paradise, broke the enchantment of the cloudy sea and
found a new world, it was but to light upon the same race of
men, deluding themselves with the same hope of earthly joys,
the same fiction of a long-lost garden of their youth" (M. N.
W., p. 87). Elsewhere he says: "Once again, in the legends of
the Mixtecas, we hear the old story repeated of the garden
where the first two brothers dwelt.... 'Many trees were
there, such as yield flowers and roses, very luscious fruits,
divers herbs, and aromatic spices'" (M. N. W., p. 90). Corresponding
to the golden age among the Greeks was the Parsee
conception of the reign of Yima, a mythological monarch who
was in immediate and friendly intercourse with Ahura-Mazda.
Yima's kingdom is thus described in the Vendidad: "There
was there neither quarreling nor disputing; neither stupidity
nor violence; neither begging nor imposture; neither poverty
nor illness. No unduly large teeth; no form that passes the
measure of the body; none of the other marks, which are marks
of Agra-Mainyus, that he has made on men" (Av., vol. i. p. 76.—Vendidad,
Fargard ii. 116 ff.). In another passage, found in
the Khorda-Avesta, not only is the happiness of Yima's time
depicted, but it is also distinctly asserted that he fell through
sin. "During his rule there was no cold, no heat, no old age,
no death, no envy created by the Devas, on account of the
absence of lying, previously, before he (himself) began to
love lying, untrue speeches. Then, when he began to love
lying, untrue speeches, Majesty fled from him visibly with the
body of a bird" (Av., vol. iii. p. 175.—Khorda-Avesta, xxxv.
32, 34).</p>

<p>More elaborately than in any of these systems is the fall of
man described in the mythology of Buddhism. In this religion,
as in that of the Jews, man is of divine origin, though after a
somewhat different fashion. A spiritual being, or god, fell from
one of the upper spheres, to be born in the world of man.
Through the progressive increase of this being arose "the six
species of living creatures in the three worlds." The most eminent
of these species, Man, enjoyed an untold duration of life
(another point in which Buddhistic legends resemble those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540"> 540</span>
the Hebrews). Locomotion was carried on through the air;
they did not consume impure terrestrial food, but lived on
celestial victuals; and propagation, since there was no distinction
of sex, was carried on by means of emanation. They did
not require sun or moon, for they saw by their own light.
Alas! one of these pure beings was tempted by a fool called
earth-butter and ate it. The rest followed its example. Hereupon
the heavenly food vanished; the race lost their power of
going about the sky, and ceased to shine by their own light.
This was the origin of the evil of the darkening of the mind.
As a consequence of these deeds, sun, moon, and stars appeared.
Still greater calamities were in store for men. Another, at another
time, ate a different kind of food, an example again followed
by the rest. In consequence of this, the distinctions of
sex were established in them; passion arose; they began to beget
children. This was the origin of the evil of sensual love.
On a further occasion, one of them ate wild rice, and all lived
for a time on wild rice, gathered as it was needed for immediate
consumption. But when some foolish fellow took it into his
head to collect enough for the following day, the rice ceased to
grow without cultivation. This was the origin of the evil of
idle carelessness. It being now necessary to cultivate rice,
persons began to appropriate and quarrel about land, and even
to kill one another. This was the origin of the evil of
anger. Again, some who were better off hid their stores from
those who were not so well off. This was the origin of the evil
of covetousness. In course of time the age of men began to
decline so as to be expressible in numbers. It continues gradually
to decline until a turning-point arrives, at which it again
increases (G. O. M., p. 5-9).</p>

<p>Several points of similarity between the Hebrew myth and
that just narrated will doubtless occur to the reader. The fall
of man is due, in this, as in Genesis, to the eating of a peculiar
food by a single person; and this example is followed, in the
one case, by the only other inhabitant; in the other, by all.
The calamity thus entailed does not terminate in the loss of
former pleasures, but extends to the introduction of crime and
sexual relations. Eve is cursed by having to bear children; the
same misfortune happened to the Buddhist women. Cain quar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541"> 541</span>reled
with Abel and killed him; so did the landed proprietors
in the Indian legend quarrel with and kill one another.</p>

<p>The fourth question which appeared to have engaged the
attention of the authors of Genesis was that of the variety of
languages. How was it, if all mankind were descended from a
single pair, and if again all but the Noachian family had been
drowned, that they did not all speak the pure language in
which Adam and Eve had conversed with their Creator in Paradise?
Embarrassed by their own theories, the writers attempted
to account for the phenomenon of the diverse modes of speech
in use among men by an awkward myth. Men had determined
to build a town, with a tower which should reach to heaven.
Jehovah, however, came down one day to see what they were
about, and was filled with apprehension that, if they succeeded
in this undertaking, he might find it impossible to prevent them
from carrying out their wishes in other ways also, whatever
those wishes might be. So he determined to confound their
language, that they might not understand one another, and by
this happy contrivance put an end to the construction of the
dangerous tower (Gen. xi. 1-9).</p>

<p>We have anticipated the course of the narrative in order to
consider the solutions offered in Genesis of the four principal
problems with which it attempts to deal. We must now return
to the point at which we left the parents of the race, namely,
immediately after their expulsion from Eden. They now began
to beget children rapidly; and Adam's eldest son, Cain, afterwards
killed his second son, Abel, for which Jehovah cursed
him as he had previously cursed his parents. Adam and Eve
had several other children, and (though this is nowhere expressly
stated, but only implied) the brothers and sisters united
in marriage to carry out the propagation of the species. In
course of time, however, the "sons of God" began to admire
the beauty of the "daughters of men," and to take wives from
among them. Jehovah, indignant at such a scandal, fixed the
limits of man's life—which had hitherto been measured by
centuries—at 120 years. At the same time there were giants on
earth. Now Jehovah saw that the human race was extremely
wicked, so much so, that he began to wish he had never created
it. To remedy this blunder, however, he determined to destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542"> 542</span>
it; and in order that the improvement should be thorough, to
destroy along with it all cattle, creeping things, and birds, who
had not (so far as we are aware,) entered into the same kind
of irregular alliances with other species as men. Nevertheless,
he had still a lingering fondness for his handiwork, badly as it
had turned out; and therefore determined to preserve enough
of each kind of animal, man included, to carry on the breed
without the necessity of resorting a second time to creation.
Acting upon this resolve, he ordered an individual named Noah
to build an ark of gopher-wood, announcing that he would
shortly destroy all flesh, but wished to save Noah and his three
sons, with their several wives. He also desired him to take two
members of each species of beasts and birds, or, according to
another account, seven of each clean beast and bird, and two
of each unclean beast; but in any case taking care that each
sex should be represented in the ark. When Noah had done all
this, the waters came up from below and down from above, and
there was an increasing flood for forty days. All terrestrial life
but that which floated in the ark was destroyed. At last the
waters began to ebb, and finally the ark rested on the 17th day
of the 7th month on Mount Ararat. After forty more days Noah
sent out a raven and a dove, of which only the dove returned.
In seven days he sent the dove again, and it returned, bringing
an olive-leaf; and after another week, when he again sent it
out, it returned no more. It was not, however, till the 27th of
the 2d month of the ensuing year (these chroniclers being very
exact about dates) that the earth was dried, and that Noah and
his party were able to quit the ark. To commemorate the
goodness of God in drowning all the world except himself and
his family, Noah erected an altar and offered burnt-offerings of
every clean beast and every clean fowl. The effect was instantaneous.
So pleased was Jehovah with the "pleasant smell,"
that he resolved never to destroy all living beings again, though
still of opinion that "the imagination of man's heart is evil
from his youth" (Gen. vi. 7, 8).</p>

<p>The myth of the deluge is very general. The Hebrews have
no exclusive property in it. Many different races relate it in
different ways. We may easily suppose that the partial deluges
to which they must often have been witnesses suggested the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543"> 543</span>
notion of a universal deluge, in which not only a few tribes or
villages perished, but all the inhabited earth was laid under
water; or the memory of some actual flood of unusual dimensions
may have survived in the popular mind, and been handed
down with traits of exaggeration and distortion such as are
commonly found in the narratives of events preserved by oral
tradition. Let us examine a few instances of the flood-myth.</p>

<p>The Fijians relate that the god "Degei was roused every
morning by the cooing of a monstrous bird," but that two
young men, his grandsons, one day accidentally killed and
buried it. Degei having, after some trouble, found the dead
body, determined to be avenged. The youths "took refuge
with a powerful tribe of carpenters," who built a fence to keep
out the god. Unable to take the fence by storm, Degei brought
on heavy floods, which rose so high that his grandsons and
their friends had to escape in "large bowls that happened to
be at hand." They landed at various places; but it is said that
the two tribes became extinct (Viti, p. 394).</p>

<p>The Greenlanders have "a tolerably distinct tradition" of
a flood. They say that all men were drowned excepting one.
This one beat with his stick upon the ground and thereby produced
a woman (Grönland, p. 246).</p>

<p>Kamtschatka has a somewhat similar legend, except that it
admits a larger number of survivors. Very many, according to
this version, were drowned, and the waves had sunk those who
had got into boats; but others took refuge in rafts, binding the
trees together to make them. On these they saved themselves
with their provisions and all their property. When the waters
subsided, the rafts remained on the high mountains (Kamtschatka,
p. 273).</p>

<p>Among the North Americans "the notion of a universal deluge"
was, in the time of the Jesuit De Charlevoix, "rather
wide-spread." In one of their stories, told by the Iroquois, all
human beings were drowned; and it was necessary, in order to
re-populate the earth, to change animals into men (N. F., vol.
iii. p. 345).</p>

<p>The Tupis of Brazil are supposed to be named after Tupa,
the first of men, "who alone survived the flood" (M. N. W.,
p. 185). Again, "the Peruvians imagined that <i>two</i> destructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544"> 544</span>
had taken place, the first by a famine, the second by a flood;
according to some a few only escaping, but, after the more
widely accepted opinion, accompanied by the absolute extirpation
of the race." The present race came from eggs dropped
out of heaven (Ibid., p. 213). Several other tribes relate in
diverse forms this world-wide story. In one of the versions,
found in an old Mexican work, a man and his wife are saved,
by the directions of their god, in a hollow cypress. In another,
the earth is destroyed by water, because men "did not think
nor speak of the Creator who had created them, and who had
caused their birth." "Because they had not thought of their
Mother and Father, the Heart of Heaven, whose name is Hurakan,
therefore the face of the earth grew dark, and a pouring
rain commenced, raining by day, raining by night" (Ibid., p.
206 ff.).</p>

<p>The diluvian legend appears in a very singular form in India
in the Satapatha Brâhmana. There it is stated, that in the
basin which was brought to Manu to wash his hands in, there
was one morning a small fish. The fish said to him, "Preserve
me, I shall save thee." Manu inquired from what it would save
him. The fish replied that it would be from a flood which
would destroy all creatures. It informed Manu that fishes,
while small, were exposed to the risk of being eaten by other
fishes; he was therefore to put it first into a jar; then when it
grew too large for that, to dig a trench and keep it in that;
that when it grew too large for the trench, to carry it to the
ocean. Straightway it became a large fish, and said: "Now in
such and such a year, then the flood will come; thou shalt
therefore construct a ship, and resort to me; thou shalt embark
in the ship when the flood rises, and I shall deliver thee from
it." Manu took the fish to the sea, and in the year that had
been named, "he constructed a ship and resorted to him.
When the flood rose, Manu embarked in the ship. The fish
swam towards him. He fastened the cable of the ship to the
fish's horn. By this means he passed over this northern mountain.
The fish said, 'I have delivered thee; fasten the ship to
a tree. But lest the water should cut thee off whilst thou art
on the mountain, as much as the water subsides, so much shalt
thou descend after it.' He accordingly descended after it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545"> 545</span>
much (as it subsided).... Now the flood had swept away
all these creatures; so Manu alone was left here" (O. S. T.,
vol. i. p. 183). The story goes on to relate that Manu, being
quite alone, produced a woman by "arduous religious rites,"
and that with this woman, who called herself his daughter,
"he begot this offspring, which is this offspring of Manu," that
is, the existing human race.</p>

<p>After the flood, the history proceeds for some time to narrate
the lives of a series of patriarchs, the mythological ancestors
of the Hebrew race. Of these the first is Abram, afterwards
called Abraham; to whom a solemn promise was made that he
was to be the progenitor of a great nation; that Jehovah would
bless those who blessed him, and curse those who cursed
him; and that in him all generations of the earth should be
blessed (Gen. xii. 1-3). When Abraham visited Egypt, he desired
his wife Sarah to call herself his sister, fearing lest the
Egyptians should kill him for her sake. She did so, and was
taken into Pharaoh's harem in consequence of her false statement;
but Jehovah plagued Pharaoh, and his house so severely
that the truth was discovered, and Sarah was restored to her
lawful husband. It is remarkable that Abraham is stated to
have subsequently repeated the same contemptible trick, this
time alleging by way of excuse that Sarah really was his step-sister;
and that Abraham's son, Isaac, is said to have done the
same thing in reference to Rebekah (Gen. xii. 10-20, xx., xxvi.
6-11). Abimelech, king of Gerar, who was twice imposed upon
by these patriarchs, must have thought it a singular custom of
the family thus to pass off their wives as sisters. Apparently,
too, both of them were quite prepared to surrender their consorts
to the harems of foreign monarchs rather than run the
smallest risk in their defense.</p>

<p>Abraham, at ninety-nine years of age, was fortunate in all
things but one: he had no legitimate heir. But this too was to
be given him. Jehovah appeared to him, announced himself as
Almighty God, and established with Abraham a solemn covenant.
He promised to make him fruitful, to give his posterity
the land of Canaan, in which he then was, and to cause Sarah
to have a son. At the same time he desired that all males
should be circumcized, an operation which was forthwith per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546"> 546</span>formed
on Abraham, his illegitimate son Ishmael, and all the
men in his house (Gen. xvii). In due time Sarah had a son
whom Abraham named Isaac. But when Isaac was a lad, and
all Abraham's hopes of posterity were centered in him as the
only child of Sarah, God one day commanded him to sacrifice
him as a burnt-offering on a mountain in Moriah. Without a
murmur, without a word of inquiry, Abraham prepared to obey
this extraordinary injunction, and was only withheld from
plunging the sacrificial knife into the bosom of his son by the
positive interposition of an angel. Looking about, he perceived
a ram caught in a thicket, and offered him as a burnt offering
instead of Isaac. For this servile and unintelligent submission,
he was rewarded by Jehovah with further promises as to the
amazing numbers of his posterity in future times (Gen. xxi. 1-8;
xxii. 1-19).</p>

<p>The tradition of human sacrifice, thus preserved in the story
of Abraham and Isaac, is found also in a curious narrative of
the Aitareya Brâhmana. That sacred book also commemorates
an important personage, in this instance a king, who had no
son. Although he had a hundred wives, yet none of them bore
him a male heir. He inquired of his priest, Narada, what were
the advantages of having a son, and learned that they were
very great. "The father pays a debt in his son, and gains immortality,"
such was one of the privileges to be obtained by
means of a son. The Rishi Narada therefore advised King
Harischandra to pray to Varuna for a son, promising at the
same time to sacrifice him as soon as he was born. The king
did so. "Then a son, Rohita by name, was born to him.
Varuna said to him, 'A son is born to thee, sacrifice him to me.'
Harischandra said, 'An animal is fit for being sacrificed, when
it is more than ten days old. Let him reach this age, then I
will sacrifice him to thee. At ten days Varuna again demanded
him, but now his father had a fresh excuse, and so postponed
the sacrifice from age to age until Rohita had received his full
armor." Varuna having again claimed him, Harischandra now
said, "Well, my dear, to him who gave thee unto me, I will
sacrifice thee now." But Rohita, come to man's estate, had no
mind to be sacrificed, and ran away to the wilderness. Varuna
now caused Harischandra to suffer from dropsy. Rohita, hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547"> 547</span>ing
of it, left the forest, and went to a village, where Indra, in
disguise, met him and desired him to wander. The advice was
repeated every year until Rohita had wandered six years in the
forest. This last year he met a poor Rishi, named Ajigarta, who
was starving, to whom he offered one hundred cows for one of
his three sons as a ransom for himself in the sacrifice to be
offered to Varuna. The father having objected to the eldest,
and the mother to the youngest, the middle one Sunahsepa,
was agreed upon as the ransom, and the hundred cows were
paid for him. Rohita presented to his father the boy Sunahsepa,
who was accepted by the god with the remark that a
Brahman was worth more than a Kshattriya. "Varuna then
explained to the king the rites of the Rajasuya sacrifice, at
which on the day appointed for the inauguration he replaced
the (sacrificial animal) by a man."</p>

<p>But at the sacrifice a strange incident occurred. No one
could be found willing to bind the victim to the sacrificial post.
At last his father offered to do it for another hundred cows.
Bound to the stake, no one could be found to kill him. This
act also his father undertook to do for a third hundred. "He
then whetted his knife and went to kill his son. Sunahsepa
then got aware that they were going to butcher him just as if
he were no man (but a beast). 'Well,' said he, 'I will seek
shelter with the gods.' He applied to Prajapati, who referred him
to another god, who did the same; and thus he was driven from
god to god through the pantheon, until he came to Ushas, the
dawn. However, as he was praising Ushas, his fetters fell off,
and Harischandra's belly became smaller; until at the last
verse he was free, and Harischandra well." Sunahsepa was now
received among the priests as one of themselves, and he sat
down by Visvamitra, an eminent Rishi. Ajigarta, his father,
requested that he might be returned to him, but Visvamitra
refused, "for," he said, "the gods have presented him to me."
From that time forward he became Visvamitra's son. At this
point, however, Ajigarta himself entreated his son to return to
his home, and the answer of the latter is remarkable. "Sunahsepa
answered, 'What is not found even in the hands of a
Shudra, one has seen in thy hand, the knife (to kill thy son);
three hundred cows thou hast preferred to me, O Angiras.'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548"> 548</span>
Ajigarta then answered, 'O my dear son! I repent of the bad
deed I have committed; I blot out this stain! one hundred of
the cows shall be thine!' Sunahsepa answered, 'Who once
might commit such a sin, may commit the same another time.
Thou art still not free from the brutality of a Shudra, for thou
hast committed a crime for which no reconciliation exists.'
'Yes, irreconcilable (is this act),' interrupted Visvamitra!" (A.
B., p. 460-469.)</p>

<p>On the likeness of this story to the Hebrew legend of the
intended sacrifice of Isaac, and on the difference between the
two, I shall comment elsewhere. From the days of Abraham
the history proceeds through a series of patriarchal biographies—those
of Isaac and Rebekah, of Jacob and Rachel, of Joseph
and his brothers—to the captivity of the Israelites in Egypt
under the successor of the monarch whose prime minister
Joseph had been. It is at this point that the history of the
Hebrews as a distinct nation may be said to begin. The patriarchs
belong to universal history. But from the days of the
Egyptian captivity it is the fortunes of a peculiar tribe, and
afterwards of an independent people that are followed. We have
their deliverance from slavery, their progress through the wilderness,
their triumphant establishment in their destined home,
the rise, decline, and fall of their national greatness, depicted
with much graphic power, and intermingled with episodes of
the deepest interest. It would not be consistent with the plan
or limits of this work to follow the history through its varied
details; all we can do is to touch upon it here and there, where
the adventures, institutions, or imaginations of the Hebrews
present points of contact with those of other nations as recorded
in their authorized writings.</p>

<p>It was only by the especial favor of Jehovah that the Hebrew
slaves were enabled to escape from Egypt at all. That deity
appointed a man named Moses as their leader; and, employing
him as his mouthpiece, desired Pharaoh to let them go. On
Pharaoh's refusal, he visited Egypt with a series of calamities;
all of them inadequate to the object in view, until at length
Pharaoh and all his army were overwhelmed in the Red Sea,
which had opened to allow the Israelites to pass. These last
now escaped into the wilderness, where, under the guidance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549"> 549</span>
Moses, they wandered for forty years, undergoing all sorts of
hardships, before they reached the promised land. During the
course of their travels, Jehovah gave Moses ten commandments,
which stand out from a mass of other injunctions and enactments,
by the solemnity with which they were delivered, and
by the extreme importance of their subject-matter. They are
reported to have been given to Moses by Jehovah in person on
Mount Sinai, in the midst of a very considerable amount of
noise and smoke, apparently intended to be impressive. By
these laws the Israelites were ordered—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To have no other God but Jehovah.</li>
<li>2. To make no image for purposes of worship.</li>
<li>3. Not to take Jehovah's name in vain.</li>
<li>4. Not to work on the Sabbath day.</li>
<li>5. To honor their parents.</li>
<li>6. Not to kill.</li>
<li>7. Not to commit adultery.</li>
<li>8. Not to steal.</li>
<li>9. Not to bear false witness against a neighbor.</li>
<li>10. Not to covet.</li>
</ul>


<p>Concerning these commandments, it may be observed that
the acts enjoined or forbidden are of very different characters.
Some of the obligations thus imposed are universally binding,
and the precepts relating to them form a portion of universal
ethics. Others again are of a purely special theological character,
and have no application at all except to those who hold
certain theological doctrines. Lastly, others command states of
mind only, which have no proper place in positive laws enforced
under penalties. To illustrate these remarks in detail: the four
commandments against killing, stealing, adultery, and calumny
are of universal obligation, and though they are far from exhausting
the list of actions which a moral code should prohibit,
yet properly belong to it and are among its most important
constituents. But the first, second, third, and fourth commandments
presuppose a nation believing in Jehovah as their
God; and even with that proviso the fourth, requiring the
observance of a day of rest, is purely arbitrary; belonging only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550"> 550</span>
to ritual, not to morals. To place it along with prohibitions of
murder and theft, is simply to confuse in the minds of hearers
the all-important distinction between special observances and
universal duties. Again, the fifth and tenth commandments
require mere emotional conditions; respect for parents in the
one case, absence of covetousness in the other. No doubt both
these mental conditions have actions and abstinences from
action as their correlatives; but it is with these last that law
should deal, and not with the mere states of feeling over which
no commandment can exercise the smallest control. Law may
forbid us to annoy our neighbor, or do him an injury on account
of his wife whom we love, or his estate which we desire to possess;
but it is idle to forbid us to wish that the wife or the
estate were ours.</p>

<p>These errors are avoided in the five fundamental commandments
of Buddhism, which relate wholly to matters that, if
binding upon any, are binding upon all. They are these:—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. Not to kill.</li>
<li>2. Not to steal.</li>
<li>3. Not to indulge in illicit pleasures of sex.</li>
<li>4. Not to lie.</li>
<li>5. Not to drink intoxicating liquors.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></li>
</ul>


<p>No doubt the fifth is not of equal importance with the rest;
yet its intention is simply to put a stop to drunkenness, and
this it accomplishes, like teetotal societies, by requiring entire
abstinence. Probably in hot climates, and with populations
not capable of much self-control, this was the wisest way.
The third commandment, as I have presented it, is somewhat
vague, but this is because the form in which it is given by the
authorities is not always the same. Sometimes it appears as a
mere prohibition of all unchastity; but the more probable view
appears to be that of Burnouf, who interprets it as directed
against adultery, in substantial accordance with Alabaster, who
renders it as an injunction "not to indulge the passions, so as
to invade the legal or natural rights of other men."</p>

<p>In the eight principal commandments of the Parsees, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551"> 551</span>
breach of which was to be punished with death, there is the
the same confusion of theological and natural duties as in the
Hebrew Bible. The Parsees were forbidden—</p>


<ul>
<li>1. To kill a pure man (<i>i. e.</i>, a Parsee).</li>
<li>2. To put out the fire Behram.</li>
<li>3. To throw the impurity from dead bodies into fire or water.</li>
<li>4. To commit adultery.</li>
<li>5. To practice magic or contribute to its being practiced.</li>
<li>6. To throw the impurity of menstruating women into fire or water.</li>
<li>7. To commit sodomy with boys.</li>
<li>8. To commit highway-robbery or suicide (Av., vol. ii. p. lx).</li>
</ul>


<p>Besides these commandments, Jehovah gave his people a
vast mass of laws, amounting in fact to a complete criminal
code, through his mouthpiece Moses. Among these laws were
those which were written on the two tables of stone, commonly
though erroneously supposed to have been the ten commandments
of the twentieth chapter. The express statement of
Exodus forbids such a supposition. It is there stated that when
God had finished communing with Moses he gave him "two
tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of
God." This most valuable autograph Moses had the folly to
break in his anger at finding that the Israelites, led by his
brother Aaron, had taken to worshiping a golden calf in his
absence (Ex., xxxi. 18, and xxxii. 19). God, however, desired him
to prepare other tables like those he had destroyed, and kindly
undertook to write upon them the very words that had been on
the first. Apparently, however, he only dictated them to Moses,
who is said to have written upon the tables "the words of the
covenant, the ten commandments." What these words were
there can be no doubt, for he had begun his address to Moses
by saying, "Behold, I make a covenant;" and had concluded
it by the expression, "Write thou <i>these</i> words: for after the
tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and
with Israel" (Ex. xxxiv. 1-28). Now the commandments thus
asserted to have been written on the tables of stone were very
different from the ten given before on Mount Sinai, and resemble
more closely still the style of those quoted from the Parsee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552"> 552</span>
books. Yet they were evidently deemed by the writers of great
importance, from the honor ascribed to them of having been
originally written in God's own handwriting on stone. Their
purport is:—1. To forbid any covenant with the inhabitants of
the land to which the Israelites were going, and to enjoin them
to "destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their
groves;"—2. To require the observance of the feast of unleavened
bread;—3. To lay claim to firstlings for Jehovah, and demand
their redemption;—4. To command the Sabbatical rest;—5.
To enjoin the observance of the feast of weeks;—6. To desire
that all males should appear thrice yearly before the Lord;—7.
To forbid the sacrifice of blood with leaven;—8. To forbid
leaving the sacrifice of the feast of the passover till morning;—9.
To demand the first-fruits for Jehovah;—10. To forbid
seething a kid in its mother's milk.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Eminent as Moses was, and high as he stood in the favor of
his God, he was not permitted to lead his people to Canaan.
Jehovah punished him for a momentary weakness by depriving
him of that privilege, which was reserved for Joshua. Just as
the waters of the Red Sea were cleft in two to allow the Israelites
to quit Egypt, so were those of the Jordan cleft in two to
allow them to enter Canaan. No sooner did the feet of the
priests bearing the ark touch the water, than the portion of the
river below was cut off from that above, the upper waters rising
into a heap (Josh. iii). Striking as this miracle is, it is not
more so than that performed by Visvamitra, an Indian sage.
When he arrived at a river which he desired to cross, that holy
man said: "Listen, O sisters, to the bard who has come to you
from afar with wagon and chariot. Sink down; become fordable;
reach not up to our chariot-axles with your streams. (The
rivers answer): We shall listen to thy words, O bard; thou hast
come from far with wagon and chariot. I will bow down to
thee like a woman with full breast (suckling her child), as a
maid to a man will I throw myself open to thee. (Visvamitra
says): When the Bharatas, that war-loving tribe, sent forward,
impelled by Indra, have crossed thee, then thy headlong current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553"> 553</span>
shall hold on its course. I seek the favor of you the adorable.
The war-loving Bharatas have crossed; the Sage has obtained
the favor of the rivers. Swell on, impetuous and fertilizing; fill
your channels; roll rapidly" (O. S. T., vol. i. p. 340).</p>

<p>So that the very same prodigy which, according to the Book
of Joshua, was wrought for the benefit of the Hebrew people in
Palestine, was, according to the Rig-Veda, wrought for the benefit
of a warlike tribe in India.</p>

<p>After their arrival and settlement in Palestine the Israelites
passed through a period of great trouble and disturbance. The
government was a direct theocracy; men appointed by God,
that is, self-appointed, put themselves at the head of affairs and
governed with more or less success under the inspiration, and in
the name of Jehovah. During this time the people were exposed
to great annoyance from their enemies the Philistines, by
whom they were for a certain space held in subjugation. The
legend of the national hero and deliverer, Samson, falls within
this period of depression under a foreign yoke. Samson is the
Jewish Herakles, and his exploits are altogether as fabulous as
those of his Hellenic counterpart; though it is not impossible
that such a personage as Samson may have lived and may have
led the people with some glory against their hereditary enemies.
Many internal disturbances contributed to render the condition
of the Israelites under their theocracy far from enviable; and
at length, under the government of Samuel, the last representative
of this state of things, the people could bear their distress
no longer and united to demand a king. The request was
undoubtedly a wise one; for the authority of a monarch was
eminently needed to give internal peace and protection against
external attacks to the distracted nation. Samuel, however,
was naturally opposed to such a change. His feelings and his
interests were alike concerned in the maintenance of the direct
government of Jehovah, whose plenipotentiary he was. But all
his representations that the proposal to elect a king was a
crime in the eyes of God, were unavailing. He was compelled
to yield, and selected, as the monarch appointed by Jehovah
himself, a young man named Saul. Before long, however, Jehovah
discovered that he had made a mistake, and that Saul was
not the kind of man he had hoped to find him. Samuel was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554"> 554</span>
therefore desired to anoint David to supplant him. In other
words, Saul did not prove the obedient instrument which Samuel
had hoped to make of him, and he therefore entered into a
secret conspiracy to procure his deposition. The conduct of
Saul, and his relations to David, have probably been misrepresented
by the ecclesiastical historians, who persistently favor
David. Nevertheless, they cannot wholly disguise the lawless
and savage career of this monarch before his accession to the
throne, of which at length he obtained possession. Nor was his
conduct during his occupation of it altogether exemplary. He,
however, promoted the views of the priestly party, and this was
enough to cover a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>His son Solomon who succeeded him was the most magnificent
of the monarchs of Israel and the last who ruled over the
undivided kingdom. He was especially renowned for his wisdom,
which is exemplified by a famous decision. Two women
came before him to dispute the ownership of an infant. One
of them stated that the other, who was alone in the same
house with her, had killed her own child by lying upon it
during the night, and taken the living child from its mother
while that mother was asleep. The other asserted that the living
child was hers. Having heard the two statements, the king
ordered the living child to be cut in two and half given to each
woman. Hereupon the one declared that she would prefer to
resign it altogether; but the other professed her acquiescence
in the judgment. The king at once awarded it to her who had
been willing to resign it rather than see it divided (1 Kings, iii.
16-28). Equal, or perhaps even greater wisdom, was displayed
by a monarch whose history is recorded in one of the sacred
books of Buddhism. Two women were contending before him
about their right to a boy. He desired each of them to take
hold of it by one of its hands and to pull at it; the one who
succeeded in getting it to keep it. She who was not the mother
pulled unmercifully; whereas the true mother, though stronger
than her rival, only pulled gently in order to avoid hurting it.
The king perceived the truth, and adjudged it to the one who
had pulled it gently (G. O. M., p. 344).</p>

<p>Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, failing to conciliate
the people at his accession, brought about the schism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555"> 555</span>
between Sâmaria and Judea, between the ten tribes and the
two, which was never afterwards healed. After this the government
in each kingdom may be described as absolute monarchy
tempered by prophetical admonition. The prophets, who
formed a kind of professional body of advisers in the interest
of Jehovah, made it their business to reprove the crimes, and
especially the idolatries of the kings. They exercised the kind
of influence which a <i>corps diplomatique</i> may sometimes exercise
on a feeble court. The monarchs sometimes attended to their
advice; sometimes rejected it; and they receive commendation
or reproof at the hands of the historians according to their conduct
in this respect. Two of these prophets, Elijah and Elisha,
were men of great eminence, and their actions are recorded at
length. Such was the power of Elisha that when, on one occasion,
he cursed some children who had called him bald head,
she-bears came out of the wood and ate forty-two of them (2
Kings, ii. 23-25). Respect for ecclesiastics or prophets is sometimes
inculcated by such decided measures as these. A young
Buddhist monk once laughed at another for the alacrity with
which he leapt over a grave, saying he was as active as a monkey.
The man whom he had ridiculed told him that he belonged
to the highest rank in the Church; that is, that he was an
Arhat. Upon hearing this the young monk was so alarmed
that all his hair stood on end, and he begged for forgiveness.
His repentance saved him from being born in hell; but because
he had laughed at an Arhat he was condemned to be born 500
times as a monkey (G. O. M., p. 351).</p>

<p>Elisha's powers in other respects were not less wonderful.
He could cause iron to swim, could foretell the course of events
in a war, could restore the dead to life, and could smite the
king's enemies with blindness (2 Kings, vi. 7). In this last accomplishment
he has rivals, as Canon Callaway has correctly
noted, among the Amazulu priests. The Amazulus have a word
in their language to describe the practice. "It is called an
<i>umlingo</i>," they say, if, when a chief is about to fight with another
chief, his doctors cause a darkness to spread among his
enemies, so they are unable to see clearly (R. S. A., vol. iii. p. 338).</p>

<p>The kingdom of Israel, unfaithful to the worship of Jehovah,
fell under the yoke of Shalmaneser, King of Assyria; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556"> 556</span>
Judah, though attacked and summoned to submit, by his successor,
Sennacherib (or more correctly Sanherib), remained independent
some time longer. The King of Judah was at this
time Hezekiah, a man thoroughly imbued with the principles
of the Jehovistic party, and therefore much lauded by the historians.
The prophet of the day was Isaiah, one of the most
eminent of those who have filled the prophetic office. Isaiah
warmly encouraged Hezekiah to resist the designs of conquest
cherished by Sanherib, and promised a successful issue. The
messengers of the Assyrian monarch had insultingly reproached
Jehovah with his inability to deliver the land, alleging that
none of the gods of the territories which he had conquered had
availed them anything. But a signal confutation of this profane
belief in large armies as against deities was about to be
given, and that in a manner which gave an equally signal triumph
to Jehovah, the god of the Jews, and Ptah, the god of
the Egyptians. Sanherib was engaged in an expedition against
Egypt, which was governed at this time by a priest-king, resembling
Hezekiah in the piety of his character. This priest
was in bad odor with his army, who refused to assist him
against the invaders. During his trouble on this account, the
god whom he served appeared to him in his sleep and promised
that he should suffer nothing, for he would send him his divine
assistance, just as Jehovah promised deliverance through the
mouth of Isaiah. He therefore went with some followers to
Pelusium, and when there, a number of field-mice, pouring in
upon the Assyrians, devoured their quivers, their bows, and
the handles of their shields, so that on the next day they fled
defenseless, and many were killed. Herodotus tells us that in
his day there was still to be seen the statue of the king in the
temple of Ptah, a mouse in his hand, and this inscription:
"Whoever looks on me, let him revere the gods" (Herod., ii.
141). In the Hebrew version of this catastrophe, the field-mice
are converted into the angel of the Lord, and the destruction
of the weapons into the slaughter by that angel of 185,000 men.
Sanherib, it is added, returned to Nineveh, where he was assassinated
by his two sons (2 Kings, xix. 35-37). But Sanherib himself,
in a deciphered inscription, declares that he had beaten
the Egyptians, subjected Judea, carried off many of its inhabit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557"> 557</span>ants,
and only left Jerusalem to the king (R. I., p. 328). Certainly
this statement is strongly confirmed, so far as Judea is
concerned, by the admission of the historians themselves, that
Sanherib had taken the fenced cities of the country; that Hezekiah
had made an unreserved submission to him, and had
even sent him, by way of tribute, not only all the treasures in
his own palace and in the temple, but the very gold from the
doors of the temple, and from the pillars which he himself had
overlaid (2 Kings xviii. 13-16). So humiliating a position went
far to justify the taunts of the Assyrian ambassadors, that the
god of Judea was no more to be trusted as a defense against
material weapons than the gods of the subjugated nations.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of the favor of Heaven towards Hezekiah
was subsequently evinced. The king fell dangerously ill,
and was warned by Isaiah to make the necessary arrangements
in view of his death, which was about to happen. Hezekiah
did not bear the announcement with much dignity. He passionately
implored Jehovah to remember his piety and good
deeds, and then "wept sore." Moved by this pitiable supplication,
Jehovah sent Isaiah back again to promise him fifteen
years' more life. On Hezekiah's asking for a sign that he would
be healed, Isaiah asked him whether he would prefer that the
shadow on the dial should advance or go back ten degrees.
Hezekiah, thinking that it was a mere trifle for a god to cause
it to advance, desired that it might turn backwards (2 Kings,
xx. 1-11).</p>

<p>A similar grace was shown towards King Woo in China, but
in this case it was the prayer of others, not his own, that
effected his recovery. His brother, the Duke of Chow, erected
four altars, put certain symbols upon them, and addressed himself
to three departed kings. "The <i>grand</i> historian <i>by his order
wrote</i> on tablets his prayer to the following effect:—" A. B.,
your chief descendant, is suffering from a severe and dangerous
sickness;—if you three kings have in heaven the charge of
<i>watching over</i> him, <i>Heaven's</i> great son, let me, Tan, be a substitute
for his person. "I have been lovingly obedient to my
father; I am possessed of many abilities and arts which fit me
to serve spiritual beings. Your chief descendant, on the other
hand, has not so many abilities and arts as I, and is not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558"> 558</span>
capable of serving spiritual beings. And, moreover, he was
appointed in the hall of God to extend his aid to the four quarters
<i>of the empire</i>, so that he might establish your descendants
in this lower world. The people of the four quarters stand in
reverent awe of him. Oh! do not let that precious heaven-conferred
appointment fall to the ground, and all our former kings
will also have a perpetual reliance and resort. I will now seek
for your orders from the great tortoise" (C. C., vol. iii. p. 353.—Shoo
King, part 5, book 6). After this prayer, the Duke divined
with the tortoises, which gave favorable indications. "The oracular
responses" were favorable too. Accordingly the king recovered,
but the devoted brother, though he did not die, suffered
for some time from unjust suspicions, and retired from court.
This was after the decease of King Woo. The discovery of the
tablets by Woo's successor led to his restoration to favor. The
relation of the reign of Hezekiah, one of the most inglorious
of Judah's rulers, is an example of the use made of a theory
which pervades and colors the whole history of the kings from
beginning to end. That theory is, that God favored and protected
those monarchs who worshiped and obeyed his prophets,
while he punished those who worshiped other gods and neglected
his orders. The deposition of Saul, the glory of David,
the destruction of the families of Jeroboam and Baasha, the
miserable fate of Ahab and his seventy sons, the exaltation of
Jehu and his milder punishment proportioned to his mitigated
idolatry, are all examples of the prevalence of this theory.
Some of the facts indeed were rather difficult to deal with; such,
for instance, as the palpable decline of Judea under Hezekiah,
and the continuance of its previous misfortunes under Josiah,
the most praiseworthy of the kings, who, in spite of his unrivaled
piety, was slain in a battle against a mere pagan. But
inconsistencies like these might be glossed over or explained
away. The best kings might meet with the greatest calamities,
and the people of Jehovah might prove even more unfortunate
than the heathen. It mattered not. They were still under his
protection; and if they suffered, it was because they had not
worshiped him enough, or not worshiped him exclusively. With
this elastic hypothesis the key to all historical events was
found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_559"> 559</span></p>

<p>Traces of a similar theory are to be found in the sacred books
of China, though in one instance it is placed in the mouth of a
successful sovereign desirous of vindicating his supersession of
a former dynasty. It is, however, precisely in such cases, where
some David or Jehu has deposed a former monarch and taken
his throne, that this theory is useful, transferring, as it does,
the responsibility of the issue to a higher power. Thus speaks
the Chinese king:—"I have heard the saying—'God leads men
to tranquil security,' but the sovereign of Hea would not move
to such security, whereupon God sent down <i>corrections</i>, indicating
his mind to him. Këe, however, would not be warned by
God, but proceeded to greater dissoluteness and sloth and
excuses for himself. Then Heaven no longer regarded nor heard
him, but disallowed his great appointment, and inflicted extreme
punishment. Hereupon it charged your founder, T'ang the Successful,
to set Hea aside, and by means of able men to rule
the empire. From T'ang the Successful down to the Emperor
Yih, every sovereign sought to make his virtue illustrious, and
duly attended to the sacrifices. And thus it was that while
Heaven exerted a great establishing influence, preserving and
regulating the house of Yin, but its sovereigns on their part
were humbly careful not to lose the favor of God, and strove
to manifest a good-doing corresponding to that of Heaven. But
in these times, their successor showed himself greatly ignorant
of <i>the ways of</i> Heaven, and much less could it be expected of
him that he would be regardful of the earnest labors of his
fathers for the country. Greatly abandoned to dissolute idleness,
he paid no regard to the bright principles of heaven, nor
the awfulness of the people. On this account God no longer
protected him, but sent down the great ruin which we have
witnessed. Heaven was not with him because he did not seek
to illustrate his virtue. <i>Indeed</i>, with regard to all states, great
and small, throughout the four quarters of the empire, in every
case there are reasons to be alleged for their punishment....
The sovereigns of our Chow, from their great goodness, were
charged with the work of God. There was the charge to them,
Cut off Yin. <i>They proceeded to perform it</i>, and announced the
correcting work of God.... The thing was from the decree
of Heaven; do not resist me; I dare not have any further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560"> 560</span>
change for you" (C. C., vol. iii. p. 460.—Shoo King, part 5, b.
14, ii. 1-18).</p>

<p>But it was not only by interested parties that this doctrine
was proclaimed in China. The She King, a sacred book corresponding
in character to the Psalms, distinctly adopts it, and
thus gives it the highest sanction. This is the language of one
of the Odes:—</p>

<p>The Ode proceeds to relate how completely victorious this
virtuous king was over his enemies, and how perfect was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561"> 561</span>
security from invasion enjoyed by the country while he governed
it (C. C., vol. iv. p. 448.—She King, part 3, b. 1, ode 7).</p>

<p>Feelings like those that inspired the Jewish chroniclers are
still more clearly visible in the history of Thibet than in that
of China. Here the orthodox compilers frequently inform us
that the reign of a king who observed the law and honored the
clergy was distinguished in a peculiarly high degree by the prosperity
of the land and the happiness of its people. Of one, for
instance, who "entered the portals of religion" at thirty-eight
years of age, it is noted that "he founded the constitution of
the whole great nation on order, and furthered its welfare and
peace" (G. O. M., p. 201). His son made the whole great nation
happy by promoting religion and the laws (Ibid., p. 203).
Another monarch receives a still higher panegyric. "By the
unbounded honor he showed towards the clergy, he exalted
religion, so that by the religious care which he bestowed on the
inhabitants of the snow-kingdom, the welfare of the people of
Thibet equaled that of the Tegri" (gods or spirits). A painful
contrast is presented by his successor on the throne, Lang-Dharma,
who belonged to the heretical "black religion," who
destroyed the temples of Buddhism, persecuted its adherents,
burnt its books, and degraded its ministers. So impious was he,
that the very names of the three gems and of the four orders
of clergy ceased to be mentioned in the land. He met, however,
with his well-deserved punishment at the hands of a faithful
Buddhist, who assassinated him with a bow and arrow, at the
same time using words to the effect that, as Buddha overcame
the unbelievers, so he had killed the wicked king (Ibid., p. 49).
Another king "showed respect to the hidden sanctuaries,
whereby his power and the welfare of the land increased"
(Ibid., p. 321). Comparable to Josiah in his piety and reverence
for the true religion was a king whose reign is described in
glowing language by his admiring historians. "This powerful
ruler," they say, "who regarded the religion of Buddha as the
most precious gem, gave great freedoms and privileges to the
clergy." He honored temples and respected the pious endowments
of his ancestors. Not only did he punish thieves, robbers,
and similar criminals, but if any man, of high or low
position, was inimical or ill-disposed towards the faith he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562"> 562</span>
deprived of his property and reduced to the greatest distress.
Some of those whose heresy was visited with this severe chastisement
were so unreasonable as to grumble, and pointed out
that it was only the clergy who were fattening on their misery
and oppression. In saying this they pointed at the spiritual
men who passed by; whereupon the faithful king issued a
decree, saying, "It is strictly prohibited to look contemptuously
at my clergy and to point at them with the finger;" whoever
dared to do so was to have his eyes put out and his finger cut
off. Unfortunately "these orders of the pious king" led to the
formation of a party of malcontents, by two of whom he was
strangled in his sleep. The lamentations of the historian at
this untoward event are unmeasured. The power and strength
of the Thibetan kingdom ran away like the stream of spring
waters; the happiness and welfare of the people were extinguished
like a lamp whose oil is exhausted; the royal power
and majesty vanished like the colors of the rainbow; the black
religion began to prevail like a destructive tempest; the inclination
to good dispositions and good deeds was forgotten like a
dream. Moreover, the translation of religious writings remained
unfinished—for this king had also resembled Josiah in his
interest in sacred books;—and those great men who adhered
to the true religion could only weep over its decline and fall (G.
O. M., p. 361).</p>

<p>Not less pitiable was the fate of Judea under the irreligious
monarchs who followed upon Josiah. One was taken prisoner
by the king of Egypt; two others were carried off to Babylon
by Nebuchadnezzar; under the fourth, the national independence
was finally extinguished, and the people reduced to a condition
of captivity in a foreign land. This calamity is distinctly
ascribed to their neglect of the true religion, and their contempt
for the messengers of God (2 Chron. xxxvi. 14-17).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the history of the Jewish nation ends with
the Captivity. But there are still three books of a historical
character in the Old Testament, Ezra and Nehemiah, relating
the fortunes of a small number of Jews who returned to the
land of their forefathers, when a change of policy in their
rulers rendered this return possible; and Esther, containing the
account of the reception of a Jewish woman into the harem of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563"> 563</span>
a heathen king, and showing how ably she contrived to use her
influence in favor of the interests of her race.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>Job, Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes.</i></h5>

<p>The Book of Job, the Psalms attributed to David, and the
Proverbs and Ecclesiastes attributed to Solomon, resemble one
another in teaching religion and morality by the method of
short sentences or maxims. They do not, like the books we
have just examined, convey their moral by means of historical
narrative; nor do they, like the prophets, impress it in flowing
and continuous rhetoric. Between the sober and even course of
the history, and the impassioned emotional torrents poured out
by the prophets, they occupy a medium position. They are
more introspective, more occupied with feelings and reflections,
than the first; more heedful of external nature, more able to
contemplate facts, apart from their peculiar construction of
those facts, than the last.</p>

<p>Job is the story of a wealthy land-owner, concerning whom
God and Satan enter into a sort of wager; God, in the first instance,
challenging Satan to consider his piety and general good
character, and Satan replying that, if only his prosperity were
destroyed, he would curse God to his face. God then gives Satan
leave to put his theory to the test by attacks directed
against Job's property, desiring at the same time that his person
may be spared. Job bears the loss of his wealth with resignation;
but at a second colloquy Satan insinuates that his
virtue would give way if his misfortunes extended to his person.
Hereupon God gives Satan leave to attack him in every respect
so long as he spares his life. Poor Job is accordingly covered
with boils from head to foot, and his patience, proof against
poverty, breaks down under this terrible infliction. He loudly
curses the day of his birth, and wishes he had died from
the womb. After this introduction, which, in its familiar
conversations between Jehovah and the devil, resembles the
grotesque legends of the middle ages, the bulk of the book
is occupied with the complaints of Job, the discourses of
his three friends who come to comfort him, the reproaches
directed against his self-righteousness by a person named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564"> 564</span>
Elihu, and, finally, a long address—containing as it were the
moral of the tale—from the Almighty himself. At the close of
the book Job expresses his abhorrence of himself and his profound
repentance, and his former prosperity is then not only
restored but amplified to a high degree. He has seven sons and
three beautiful daughters, and dies one hundred and forty years
after the events narrated, having seen four generations of his
descendants. What was the effect on the mind of Satan of this
result, whether he considered himself defeated, or whether he
was confirmed in his malicious opinion that Job did not "fear
God for nought," is nowhere stated. But one of the most
curious features of this book is the picture it gives of that person,
as a being not altogether bad, though fond of mischief,
taking a somewhat cynical view of the motives of human conduct,
and anxious, in the interests of his theory, to try experiments
upon a subject selected for him by his antagonist, and
therefore peculiarly likely to disappoint his expectations. It
does not appear that he had any desire to hurt Job further
than was necessary for his purpose, nor is there a trace of the
bad character he subsequently obtained as a mere devil, longing
to involve men's souls in eternal destruction.</p>

<p>In the Psalms we have a series of religious songs of varying
character—praising, blessing, supplicating, complaining, lamenting,
invoking good or evil upon others, according to the mood
of the several writers, or of the same writer at different seasons.
Some of them are of considerable beauty, and express
much depth of religious feeling. Others, again, are inspired by
sentiments of malevolence, and merely appeal to God in support
of national or private animosities. As examples of the latter
class, take the 110th Psalm, supposed to have been addressed to
David, where it is predicted that "the Lord at the right hand
shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath," and that
"he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound
the heads over many countries." In the immediately preceding
Psalm, the 109th, the writer is still more vindictive, and his
enemy is more exclusively his own. He begins by calling him
"wicked," and says he has spoken against him with a lying
tongue. Premising that he is altogether in the act of prayer, he
prays against the adversary in somewhat emphatic language:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_565"> 565</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Set thou a wicked man over him, and let the accuser stand at his
right hand. When he shall be judged, let him be found guilty, and let
his prayer become sin. Let his days be few, and let another take his
office. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. Let his
children wander about and beg, and seek food far from their desolate
places. Let the creditor catch all that he hath, and strangers rob the
fruit of his industry. Let there be none to extend mercy to him, and
let none be merciful to his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut
off, and in the following generation let their name be blotted out. Let
the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord, and let not the
sin of his mother be blotted out. Let them be before the Lord continually,
and let him cut off the memory of them from the earth" (Psalms
cix. 1-15).</p>
</div>

<p>In the following verse the enemy is declared to have persecuted
the poor and needy, and this is put forward as the excuse
for imprecations evidently inspired by personal ill-will. In another
of these Psalms, Jehovah is entreated to persecute the
enemies of Israel with storm and tempest, as fires burn up
woods and flames set mountains on fire (Psalms lxxxiii. 14, 15).
Elsewhere the king is said to trust in the Lord, and he therefore
hopes that the Lord will find out his enemies, and will
make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger; that the
fire will devour them; and that he will destroy their fruit from
the earth and their seed from among the children of men (Ps.
xxi. 8-10).</p>

<p>Parallels to these Psalms of cursing may be met with in the
Veda, just as the Psalms in general are more nearly paralleled
by the Vedic hymns than by those of any other sacred book.
One poet writes as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Blinded shall ye be, O enemies, like headless snakes, and thus
plagued by Agni, may Indra always kill the best of you. Whatever
relation troubles us, whatever stranger wishes to kill us, him may all the
gods destroy; prayer is my powerful protection, my refuge and powerful
protection" (S. V., p. 297.—Sâma Veda, 2. 9. 3. 8).</p>
</div>

<p>Remarkably close is the similarity between the assertion of
the Hindu Rishi that prayer is his powerful protection, and
that of the Hebrew Psalmist that he is, or gives himself to,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566"> 566</span>
prayer. In another hymn the aid of a goddess Apvā (said to
mean "disease or fear") is invoked against the enemies of the
singer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Bewildering the hearts of our enemies, O Apvā, take possession of
their limbs and pass onwards; come near, burn them with fires in their
hearts; may our enemies fall into blind darkness (O. S. T., vol. v. p.
110).... Attack, ye heroes, and conquer; may Indra grant you protection;
may our arm be productive of terror, that ye may be unconquerable.
Arrow-goddess, sharpened by prayer; fly past as when shot
off; reach the enemies; penetrate into them; let not even one escape
thee" (S. V., p. 297.—Sâma Veda, 2. 9. 3. 5).</p>
</div>

<p>But these expressions of hostility, directed apparently against
enemies who were engaged in actual war with the friends of the
writer, make no approach in the bitterness of their curses to
the language of the Psalmist when dealing with his personal
foes. A parallel to this more private enmity may be found in
the Atharva-Veda, where the god Kama is invoked to bring
down the severest evils upon the objects of the imprecation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"With oblations of butter I worship Kama, the mighty slayer of
enemies. Do thou, when lauded, beat down my foes by thy great
might. The sleeplessness which is displeasing to my mind and eye,
which harasses and does not delight me, that sleeplessness I let loose
upon my enemy. Having praised Kama, may I rend him. Kama, do
thou, a fierce lord, let loose sleeplessness, misfortune, childlessness,
homelessness, and want upon him who designs us evil.... May
breath, cattle, life, forsake them.... Indra, Agni, and Kama,
mounted on the same chariot, hurl ye down my foes; when they have
fallen into the nethermost darkness, do thou, Agni, burn up their dwellings.
Kama, slay my enemies; cast them down into thick [literally,
blind] darkness. Let them all become destitute of power and
vigor, and not live a single day.... Let them (my enemies) float
downwards like a boat severed from its moorings.... Do thou,
Kama, drive my enemies from this world by that [same weapon or
amulet] wherewith the gods repelled the Asuras, and Indra hurled the
Dasyus into the nethermost darkness" (O. S. T., vol. v. p. 404).</p>
</div>

<p>As corresponding to the many expressions to be found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567"> 567</span>
Psalms of trust in God, of pious belief in his protection, and
of sensibility to his all-embracing knowledge, we may quote the
language of a Chinese monarch in one of the Odes of the She
King. The first six lines are, it appears, held by the current
interpretation in China to contain the admonition addressed by
the ministers to the king, and the last six the king's reply.
But we may more reasonably suppose, with Dr. Legge, that
the whole Ode is spoken by the king himself:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Let me be reverent, let me be reverent [in attending to my duties];</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">[The way of] Heaven is evident,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And its appointment is not easily [preserved].</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me not say that It is high aloft above me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It ascends and descends about our doings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It daily inspects us wherever we are.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I am [but as] a little child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without intelligence to be reverently [attentive to my duties];</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And show me how to display a virtuous conduct."<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We may fairly place this simple expression of the author's
desire to do his duty, and of his reverential consciousness that
Heaven is ever about us and "inspects us wherever we are,"
beside the words attributed to David:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O Jehovah, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest
my down-sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar
off. Thou winnowest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
with all my ways" (Psalm cxxxix. 1-3).</p>
</div>

<p>We need not dwell upon the Proverbs, traditionally ascribed
to Solomon, but scarcely worthy of the renowned wisdom of
that monarch. Some of them are indeed shrewd and well expressed;
others are commonplace; and others again display<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568"> 568</span>
more worldly wisdom than religion or virtue. Such is the
recommendation of bribery: "A gift in secret pacifieth anger,
and a reward in the bosom strong wrath" (Prov. xxi. 14);
which, if written by a king and dispenser of justice, would be
a tolerably broad hint to his loving subjects. It is noteworthy
that Christ had studied this book, and that it had sunk deep
into his mind (<i>e. g.</i>, Prov. xxv. 21, 22, and xxvii. 1). The two
concluding chapters are not by the same author, at least if we
may believe in their superscriptions. In the last of all, a king
named Lemuel repeats for the benefit of posterity the advice
given him by his mother, and no doubt by many mothers to
many sons both before and after him, to be careful about
women and not to drink wine or spirituous liquors.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastes, or Koheleth, composed (according to Ewald) in
the latter end of the Persian dominion, is the work of a cynic
who has had much experience of the world, and has found it
hollow and unsatisfactory. He is not a man of very devout
mind, and can find no comfort in the ordinary commonplaces
about the goodness of God, or the manner in which misfortunes
are sent as punishments for sin. There is much good sense
mixed with his lamentations over the vanity of life. He has
seen all the works done under the sun, and all are in his opinion
"vanity and vexation of spirit."</p>

<p>"Wisdom and knowledge do but bring more grief. Koheleth
tried various kinds of pleasure and found them vain too. He
built, he planted, he made pools of water. He procured men-servants
and maid-servants, and (as a natural consequence) had
servants born in his house. All was equally fruitless. But
whatever a man does, he has nothing but sorrow and grief.
Even wisdom is of little use, for a dolt may inherit the fruit
of the wise man's labors. Men are no better than animals; they
all die equally; all return to the dust. Who can say that man's
spirit goes upwards, and the animal's downwards? Just men
are often rewarded like wicked men, and wicked men like just
ones; this is one of the many vanities on earth. So then the
best thing a man can do is to eat, drink, and enjoy life with an
agreeable wife; for this life is all he has. Once dead, there is
no further consciousness, or participation in anything that is
going on. Whatever a man's hand finds to do, let him do it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569"> 569</span>
with all his might; for there is neither action nor knowledge in
the grave. It is well to remember God in youth before the evil
days come. Words of the wise are as goads, but book-making
and preaching are both of them a bore." Lastly, Koheleth
concludes with the pious advice to the young man whom he is
addressing, to fear God and keep his commandments, for that
God will judge every action, be it good or be it bad.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 3.</span>—<i>The Song of Solomon.</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></h5>

<p>It is a singularly fortunate circumstance that the Song of
Songs, a little work of an altogether secular nature and wholly
unlike any other portion of the Hebrew Scriptures, should have
been admitted into the Canon. Whatever may have been the
delusion, whether its reputed Solomonian authorship or some
other theory about it, under which it obtained this privilege,
we owe it to this mistake that the solitary example of the Jewish
drama in existence should have been preserved for the instruction
of modern readers. I say modern readers, because it
is not until quite recently that the dramatic character of this
piece has been ascertained and established beyond reasonable
doubt. Thanks to the scholarship of Germany and France, we
are now able to read the Song in the light of common sense.
The stern theology of Judaism is for once laid aside, and we
have before us a common love-story such as might happen
among any Gentile and unbelieving race. A young girl, called
a Sulamite, who is attached to a young man of her own rank
in life, has been carried off to the harem of Solomon against
her will. She is indifferent to the splendor of the royal palace,
and resists the amorous advances of the king. Thus she succeeds
in "keeping her vineyard;" and is rewarded by rejoining
her shepherd lover in her native village. The play is not without
beauty, although it evinces a somewhat primitive condition
of the drama at the time of its composition.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 4.</span>—<i>The Prophets.</i></h5>

<p>We have in the prophetical books a class of writings alto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570"> 570</span>gether
peculiar to the Hebrew Scriptures. The prophets were
men who during the whole course of the Hebrew monarchy,
and even long after its close, acted as the inspired organs of
the Almighty; admonishing, reproving, warning, or counseling
in his name. At first the method by which the revelations they
received were made known by them, was oral communication.
Writing was not employed by them as an instrument of prophetic
discourse until after the earliest and most flourishing
stage of the monarchy was past. Perhaps they were the most
powerful of the prophets who addressed their exhortations directly
to those for whom they were intended in eloquent discourse
or timely parable. Such prophets were Samuel, Nathan,
Elijah, and Elisha, at the courts of the several kings in whose
days they lived. Prophecy had declined a little in its influence
on the people when its representatives betook themselves to the
calmer method of written composition. Nevertheless, some of
the prophets who have left us their works in writing continued
at the same time to employ the older instrument of spoken
addresses. Isaiah and Jeremiah are conspicuous instances of
this employment of the two organs of communication downwards.
During this same period there were many prophets who
trusted exclusively to writing; while in the latest stage of prophetical
inspiration, oral instruction was altogether dropped,
and literary means alone were employed to make known the
mind of Jehovah to his chosen people.</p>

<p>The constant theme of all the prophets whose works have
come down to us is the future greatness of the Hebrew race;
their complete triumph over all their enemies; the glory of
their ultimate condition, and the confusion or destruction of
those who have opposed their march to this final victory. The
human agent by whom this great revolution is to be effected is
the Messiah. He is the destined weapon in the hand of God by
whom Jewish religion, Jewish institutions, and Jewish rulers
are to attain that supremacy over heathen religion, heathen
institutions, and heathen rulers which is their natural birthright.
Continual disappointment had no effect upon these sanguine
expectations. The Messiah <i>must</i> come, Israel <i>must</i> be
victorious over every other nation that came in the way: this
was the word of God, and it could not fail to be fulfilled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571"> 571</span>
Troubles of many kinds might beset the people in the meantime;
but of the attainment of the goal at last there could be
no doubt.</p>

<p>Of course this ever-recurring burden of the prophetic song
is varied by many strains on subordinate or outlying topics.
The prophets constantly refer to the events of the day, and use
them for their own purposes. They reprove the sins of kings
and people, endeavoring to show that these bring upon them
the misfortunes from which they suffer and which postpone the
day of their triumph over the Gentiles. They connect special
calamities with special offenses. They indicate the conduct
which under existing circumstances ought to be pursued. They
draw eloquent and beautiful pictures of the state of their own
and of foreign countries. And they endeavor to raise the popular
conceptions of the majesty of God, of his character, and his
requirements, to the level they have themselves attained.</p>

<p>Turning now to the individual books which have come down
to us in the Canon, and which must by no means be taken as
comprehending all the works of the prophets who wrote their
prophecies, we find that the oldest of these is that of Joel, the
son of Pethuel.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Joel is supposed by the highest authority to
have lived in the time of King Jehoash, or Joash, who is praised
for his devout obedience to Jehoiada, the priest (2 Kings, xii).
His prophecy was occasioned by a devastation of locusts. Locusts
had wasted the land for some years, and there had been
drought at the same time. On the occasion of a long drought
Joel feared a fresh invasion of locusts, and therefore summoned
his people to a festival of repentance at the temple. This festival
occurred, and rain soon followed (P. A. B., vol. i. p. 87 ff.).
Here the old notion of a direct connection between the attention
paid by the people to Jehovah and his care for them is
almost grotesquely manifested. Locusts are to be averted by
fasting; rain obtained by rather more than usual devotion to
God. On the other hand, the more spiritual view of religion to
which the prophets generally tend, is shown in the order to the
people to rend their hearts and not their garments. After thus
attending to immediate necessities, Joel in stirring language ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572"> 572</span>horts
the people to war, hoping that they would thus get rid of
the foreign oppressors who had broken into the sunken kingdom
of David. He bids them beat their plough-shares into
swords, and their pruning-hooks into spears, and desires the
weak to say that they are strong. He promises his people
revenge over their enemies, and holds out the cheering prospect
of a time when, instead of their sons and daughters being sold
as slaves to strangers, they will themselves make slaves of the
sons and daughters of the heathen.</p>

<p>Some short passages subsequently embodied by Isaiah in his
works are considered by Ewald to belong to the same early age
as Joel. The next complete prophet, however, in order of time,
was Amos, whose revelations applied to the northern kingdom
and threatened it with invasion by the Assyrians. Amos in fact
utters a series of threatening predictions against various peoples,
and his tone is mainly that of reproof. While, however, he foretells
the captivity of Israel, and holds out nothing but the most
depressing prospects of ruin and misery throughout the bulk
of his book, he falls at the end into the accustomed strain of
hopeful exultation. "The tabernacle of David" is to be raised
up; Israel is to be supreme over the heathen; and the Israelites
are not to be disturbed again from the land which God has
given them, where exuberant prosperity is to be their lot. Incidentally,
Amos tells us a little of his personal history, which
is not without interest. He attributes his consecration to the
prophetic office to the direct intervention of Jehovah. He had
originally no connection with other prophets, but was a simple
herdsman, and was employed to gather sycamore fruit. But
Jehovah took him while he was following the flock, and said,
"Go, prophecy unto my people Israel." His is thus a typical
case of the belief in immediate inspiration, and he is an example
of the kind of character which led to the existence among
the Israelites of the peculiar and powerful class who were holy,
but not consecrated. Amos also tells us of a quarrel he had
had with Amaziah, a priest at the court of Jeroboam. This
priest had complained of his dismal predictions to the king, and
had bidden him go to Judah and prophecy there. In return for
this evidence of hostility Amos informs the priest that his wife
is to become a prostitute in the town, that his sons and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573"> 573</span>
daughters are to fall by the sword, that his land is to be
divided by lot, and that he himself is to die on polluted soil
(Amos vii. 10-17). Such were the courtesies that passed between
rival teachers of religion at the court of Jeroboam.</p>

<p>Hosea also tells us something of his personal affairs, more
especially of his matrimonial relations, in which he was far
from fortunate. We feel, in his opening chapters, the soreness
of a husband whose wife has contemned his company and
sought the amusement of a troop of lovers. Gomer, in fact,
was shockingly unfaithful, and Hosea uses her as a type of the
infidelity of Israel to Jehovah. At length she deserted him
altogether, and went to another house, but he brought her back
as a slave and put her under strict conjugal discipline. In like
manner is Israel to return to her God, whom she has deserted
for a time, and under the influence of God's love, freely bestowed
after his anger has passed away, is to enjoy a period of great
prosperity. Hosea, it will be observed, belonged to the northern
kingdom, and his book is preëminently the Ephraimitic book of
prophecy. But he wrote it in Judah. He worked in the north
at two distinct epochs, first towards the close of Jeroboam II.'s
reign, afterwards in the time of Zachariah, Shallum, and Menahem
(P. A. B., vol. i. p. 171 ff.).</p>

<p>An anonymous prophet, contemporary with Isaiah, stands
next in order of time. He is the author of Zechariah ix.-xi.
inclusive, and of Zechariah chap. xiii. ver. 7-9 (P. A. B., vol i.
p. 247 ff.). These chapters contain the first distinct announcement
of the advent of the Messiah, who is described in the
famous prediction of a King coming to Jerusalem on an ass,
and on a colt, the foal of an ass. Here too we find the curious
allegory of the two staves, Beauty and Bands, whereof one was
broken by the prophet in token of the breach of his covenant
with all the nations; the other, in token of the rupture of fraternal
relations between Israel and Judah. In the course of
this allegory, the prophet demands his price, thirty pieces of
silver, and throws it into the temple treasure; a passage which,
by an accidental obscurity in the Hebrew, has been mistranslated
as referring, not to the treasure, but to "the potter in the
house of Lord," and then misapplied to the betrayal of Christ
and the purchase of the potter's field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_574"> 574</span></p>

<p>In the concluding words of this prophet it is announced that
two-thirds of the people will perish, but that the remaining
third will, after refining and trial, be accepted by God as his
own people.</p>

<p>We enter now upon the consideration of a prophet who
stands in the foremost rank of those distinguished leaders of
opinion whose works have been included in the Canon. There
is no greater name among the prophets of Israel than that of
Isaiah. But in speaking of Isaiah we must not fall into the
confusion of including under his writings the compositions of a
prophet of far later date, which have been mistakenly bound
up with his. Isaiah himself cannot receive credit for all that
is published in his name. But that which he has actually left
us is enough to entitle him to admiration as a master of
rhetoric.</p>

<p>Isaiah lived in the reign of Hezekiah, and enjoyed a position
of high public consideration. Some of his prophetic sayings he
wrote down soon after he had uttered them; others not till
long after. He had begun to come forward as a prophet in the
last year of the reign of Uzziah. When he had labored a long
time in his vocation of teacher, he determined to collect his
sayings in a book. His oldest work was written about the year
740 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, just after the accession of the young and weak Ahaz
at Jerusalem, when the Assyrians had rendered the northern
kingdom tributary but had not yet come to Judea. His second
was written apparently in the reign of Hezekiah, in 724; and
his third in the days of the same king, when the service of
Jehovah had been restored. Such at least are the conclusions
of the highest living authority on the literature of the Hebrew
race (P. A. B., vol. i. p. 271 ff.).</p>

<p>The earliest stratum discernible (according to that authority)
in the Book of Isaiah is from chap. ii. 2 to chap. v. inclusive,
and chap ix. 7-x. 4. The last five verses of chap. v. should not
be taken along with the rest of the chapter, but should follow
upon chap. x. 4 (Ibid., vol. i. p. 286 ff.). These passages begin
with a beautiful description of the happiness of the Israelites
in the days of their coming glory, when the mountain of the
Lord's house will be established on the top of the mountains,
and exalted above the hills; and when all nations will flow to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575"> 575</span>
it, to worship and to learn the true faith. It is remarkable as
evidence of the wide distinction between the view of Joel and
that of Isaiah, that Isaiah exactly reverses the image of his
predecessor, declaring that swords will be beaten into plough-shares
and spears into pruning-hooks. Joel was looking to the
necessities of the immediate present; Isaiah to the prospects of
the future. These chapters also contain an amusing ironical
account of the finery of the Jerusalem ladies, which might apply
with slight alterations to the rich women of all ages and
countries. No doubt it was very offensive to Isaiah that they
should go about with necks erect and wanton eyes, walking
with a mincing gait; but a prophet who should threaten the
women of London or Paris with scab on the head and the
exposure of their persons on account of sins like these, would
certainly bring more reprobation on himself than on them. But
manners in Isaiah's days were not so delicate. A time is predicted
when Jehovah will wash away the filth of Zion's daughters,
and when all in Jerusalem shall be called holy.</p>

<p>In the second part of his book (chap. vi. 1, chap. ix. 6, and
chap. xvii. 1-11) Isaiah gives an interesting, though only figurative,
account of his consecration to the prophetic office. In the
year of King Uzziah's death he says he saw the Lord sitting on
his throne with a train so long as to fill the temple. When he
cried out that he was undone, for that he, a man of unclean
lips, had seen the King, the Lord of hosts, a seraph flew up to
him with a live coal in a pair of tongs, laid the coal on his
mouth, and told him that his iniquity was now taken away and
his sin purged. After this the voice of the Lord was heard inquiring
whom he should send, and Isaiah offered to take the
post of his ambassador: "Here am I, send me." The proposal
was accepted, and he at once received his instructions from
headquarters. The prophet began to preach in the manner
desired, and among much discouraging matter he uttered the
magnificent description of the Messiah, which is familiar to
all:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_576"> 576</span></p>

<p>Isaiah's third work (composed in the reign of Hezekiah)
begins at the first chapter of the canonical book. It opens with
a pathetic lamentation over the infidelity of the children of
Israel to their God, and proceeds at chap. xiv. 28 to recount a
"burden" which came in the death-year of King Ahaz. A
prophecy by which a much older prophet (belonging, as is supposed,
to the time of Joel) is embodied in "the burden of
Moab," and extends through chap. xv. and chap. xvi. 7-12, after
which Isaiah, having mentioned that this was formerly the word
of the Lord about Moab, proceeds to say that his present word
is that within three years the glory of Moab shall be contemned.
The latter part of chap. xxi. (ver. 11-17), dealing with Dumah
and Arabia, also belongs to this period.</p>

<p>Further divisions are distinguishable in the writings of Isaiah
after these three parts have been separated from the rest.
Thus, we have a fourth division consisting of the 22d and 23d
chapters, and containing a personal attack on Shebna and a
prediction of the fall of Tyre. A fifth division, from chap.
xxviii. to xxxii. inclusive, ends with a beautiful description of
the happier time that is to come, when the fruit of justice will
be peace, and the result of justice quietness and security, when
the people will dwell in sure habitations and untroubled abodes.
There is another writing, the sixth in order, which begins at
chap. x. 5, and extends, in the first instance, to the end of
chap. xii. This prophecy is remarkable, even in this eloquent
book, for the marvelous eloquence with which, in his visions
of future glory, the inspired seer depicts the government of the
"rod out of the stem of Jesse," the "Branch" that is to "grow
out of his roots," in whose reign the wild beasts will no longer
persecute their prey, nor Ephraim and Judah keep up the
memory of their ancient feud; who will cause his beloved people
to put the Philistines to flight, to conquer Edom and Moab,
and reduce the children of Ammon to submission. Prophecies
directed against Ethiopia and Egypt (chap. xvii. 12-xviii. 7, and
chap. xx.) belong to the same portion of Isaiah's collected
works. Threats against the Assyrians are contained in additional
chapters, namely, chap. xxxiii. and chap. xxxvii. 22-35.
Lastly, a seventh portion of Isaiah consists of chap. xix., which,
after holding out the prospect of great misfortunes to Egypt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577"> 577</span>
ends in a somewhat unusual strain by admitting both Egyptians
and Assyrians to be equal sharers with the Israelites in the
ultimate prosperity of the earth, and declaring that the Lord
himself will bless them all, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people,
and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance."</p>

<p>It should be noted that, if Ewald's supposition be correct,
the first four sections of the work, thus decomposed into
its several constituents, were edited by Isaiah himself, while the
fifth, sixth, and seventh were added by subsequent compilers to
the collection he had left behind (P. A. B., vol. i. p. 488).</p>

<p>A very short prophecy called by Obadiah's name follows
upon the genuine writings of Isaiah in chronological order. It
is in fact anonymous. In its present form it belongs to the
time of the Captivity. The object of the unknown prophet was
to reprove the Idumeans for rejoicing in and profiting by the
destruction of Jerusalem. In his writing he embodied an older
prophecy by the actual Obadiah, referring to a calamity that
had befallen Edom, when a part of its territory had been surprised
and completely plundered by a people with whom it had
just been in alliance. The same old piece was used by Jeremiah
(chap. xlix. 7) in his prophecy upon Edom (Ib., vol. i. p.
489 ff.).</p>

<p>Micah, the next prophet, was a younger contemporary of
Isaiah, but lived in the country. When he wrote the northern
kingdom was approaching its end, and he threatens Judah with
chastisement and destruction. He foresaw the fulfillment of
Messianic hopes as arising only from the ruin of the existing
order of things. No more than the first five chapters are by
Micah himself (Ib., vol. i. p. 498 ff.). His book is remarkable for
the extremely warlike description he gives of Messianic happiness.
Many other prophets conceive it as an important element
in that happiness that the Israelites shall be victorious over
their enemies; but few, if any, have come up to Micah in the
fervor with which he foretells the desolation, the carnage, the
utter suppression of rival nations, which will accompany that
age. The author of the scenes of blood will be the ruler who is
to come from Bethlehem-Ephratah. The prophet who has
added the last two chapters also looks forward to an age when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578"> 578</span>
Jehovah will at length perform his promises to Abraham and
Jacob, to the terror of the unbelieving nations.</p>

<p>Next after Micah stands Nahum. The occasion of his prophecy
was a hostile attack directed against Nineveh. He must
have seen the danger with his own eyes, and he was therefore
a descendant of one of the Israelites who had been carried off
to Assyria. He evidently lived far from Palestine, and was
familiar with Assyrian affairs. Elkosh, where the inscription
places his residence, was a little town on the Tigris. His book
may refer to the siege of Nineveh by the Median king Phraortes
about six hundred and thirty-six (P. A. B., vol. ii. p. 1). The
interest of Nahum's prophecy is merely local; he does not rise
beyond the politics of the hour, and we need not therefore stop
to examine his utterances in detail. It may be noted, however,
that an expression which has become famous through its adoption
by a much later prophet, "Behold, upon the mountains the
feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace,"
is first found in Nahum.</p>

<p>Zephaniah's prophecy arose out of a great movement of
nations. He lived in the reign of Josiah, but wrote before the
reformation effected by that monarch. The movement alluded
to by him must have been the great irruption of the Scythians
mentioned by Herodotus as having interrupted the siege of
Nineveh by Kyaxares, King of the Medes (Herod., i. 103). These
last days of the Assyrian kingdom gave rise to long disturbances
in which the Chaldeans became conquerors (P. A. B., vol.
ii. p. 14). After various threatenings against divers people, the
prophecy of Zephaniah ends with a beautiful vision of the age
to come, when the suppliants of Jehovah will come from beyond
the rivers of Ethiopia; and when a virtuous and happy remnant
will be left in Israel.</p>

<p>When Habakkuk, the next prophet, wrote his thoughts, and
composed the public prayer or psalm which forms his concluding
chapter, the Chaldeans were already in the land. This "bitter
and hasty nation" was quite a new phenomenon there.
Habakkuk lived after the reformation of Josiah, and therefore
in the reign of Jehoiakim (Ib., vol. ii. p. 29). He seems to have
written to plead with the Almighty for deliverance, and to express
unabated confidence in him; and he hoped that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579"> 579</span>
words, set to music and sung in public worship, would induce
him to abate his anger as manifested in the Chaldean scourge.</p>

<p>An anonymous prophet (Ib., vol. ii. p. 52) (Zechariah xiii.
1-xiii. 6, and xiv.) predicts the siege and capture of Jerusalem,
with all the miserable incidents of conquest: the rifling of her
houses, the ravishing of her women, the condemnation to captivity
of half her inhabitants. Like other prophets, however,
he looks forward in sanguine anticipation to a day when the
heathen nations who now make war upon Jerusalem will regularly
go up there every year to worship Jehovah, and keep
the feast of tabernacles. At least if any of them do not, they
will have no rain. In that glorious age the very pots in the
Lord's house will be like the bowls for offerings; nay, every
pot in Judah and Jerusalem will be holy to the Lord of hosts.</p>

<p>We pass now to the consideration of a prophet who stands
second in eminence only to Isaiah, and to the unknown author
of the later work which in the Canon is included in the Book
of Isaiah. Jeremiah began to prophesy in the thirteenth year
of Josiah, and continued to do so during the reigns of Jehoiakim
and Zedekiah. His active life, like that of Isaiah, extended
over a period of half a century (P. A. B., vol. ii. p. 63 ff.). It is
noteworthy that Jeremiah was a priest, and therefore combined
in his person the double qualification of consecration and of
exceptional holiness: that is, he was consecrated to Jehovah,
and also appointed expressly by Jehovah. The manner of his
appointment to be a holy person resembles the manner of the
appointment of Isaiah. The word of the Lord came to him,
saying, that before God had formed him in the belly he had
known him, and before he had come forth from the womb he
had sanctified him, and ordained him a prophet unto the
nations. Jeremiah objected that he was but a child. But Jehovah
told him not to say he was a child, for that he was to go
where he was sent, and speak what he was commanded. He
was not to be afraid of men's faces, for he, the Lord, would
deliver him. Then he touched Jeremiah's mouth with his hand,
and said: "Behold, I put my words in thy mouth. See, I
appoint thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms,
to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw
down, to build and to plant." After this solemn dedication to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580"> 580</span>
his duties Jeremiah was certainly endowed with the fullest
qualifications for the prophetic office. He immediately began
to see images; namely, a rod of an almond-tree and a seething
pot, and it continued afterwards to be one of his characteristics
to employ material imagery of this nature for the purpose of
illustrating the truths he had to communicate.</p>

<p>After this introduction, we have a long section of the work,
namely, from the second chapter to the twenty-fourth, beginning
with the prophecies of the thirteenth year of Josiah.
Among other things this portion includes Jeremiah's bitter imprecation
upon his personal enemies, the "men of Anathoth,"
on whom he begs to be permitted to witness the vengeance of
God, and concerning whom he receives the consoling assurance
that their young men will die by the sword, and their sons and
daughters by famine, and that there will not be a remnant left.
This section contains also the terrible prayer against those who
"devised devices" against Jeremiah, in other words, did not
believe in his predictions. In its intense intolerance, in its unblushing
disclosure of private malignity, in its unscrupulous
enumeration of the ills desired for these opponents of the
prophet, it is perhaps unrivaled in theological literature. To do
Jeremiah justice it ought to be quoted at length:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and listen to the voice of my opponents.
Shall evil be recompensed for good, that they dig a pit for my
life? Remember how I stood before thee, to speak a good word for
them, to turn away thy wrath from them. Therefore give their sons to
famine, and deliver them into the power of the sword; and let their
wives be bereaved of their children and widowed, and let their men be
put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. Let
a cry be heard from their houses, when thou suddenly bringest troops
upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for
my feet. Yet thou, Jehovah, knowest all their counsel against me to
slay me; and blot not out their sin from thy sight, and let them be overthrown
before thee; deal with them in the time of thine anger" (Jer.
xviii. 19-23).</p>
</div>

<p>In another chapter there is a curious account of an incident
with Pashur, superintendent of the Temple, who had caused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581"> 581</span>
Jeremiah to be put in stocks for a day. Jeremiah complains
bitterly of the treatment he meets with on account of his
prophesying, and wishes to resign the office, but the impulse
proves too strong for him. He consoles himself with a pious
hope that Jehovah will let him see his vengeance on his enemies
(Jer. xx. 1-12). He continues to predict misfortunes, but
intermingles with his gloomier forebodings a fine vision of the
time when God shall gather together the remnant of his flock
from the countries to which he has driven them, and raise up
"a righteous Branch" of the house of David, who will reign
and prosper, who will execute justice and equity, in whose days
Judah will be saved, and Israel dwell secure (Jer. xxiii. 2-6).</p>

<p>In a third section of his work (chap. xlvi. 1-12, and chap.
xlvii. 49) Jeremiah deals with foreign nations, and then (in
chap. xxv.) declares that he has been prophesying a long time
without being able to get the Jews to listen to him, foretells
their subjugation by Nebuchadnezzar, and (rather unfortunately
for his own and Jehovah's reputation for correct foresight) commits
himself to the definite term of seventy years as the duration
of the coming captivity. A wise prophet would have kept
within the safe region of vagueness, where he could not come
into collision with awkward dates nor drive orthodox interpreters
into such pitiable straits as those in which Ewald, for example,
finds himself, when he is compelled to say that seventy
years is a perfectly general indication of a future that cannot
be more precisely fixed, and that it merely refers to the third
generation from the writer (P. A. B., vol. ii. p. 230). The remainder
of this section (chap. xxvi.-xxix.) relates certain encounters
with other prophets whose predictions had turned out false,
and one of whom, as Jeremiah exultingly relates, died during
the year, exactly as Jeremiah had declared he would. Interesting
evidence is supplied by these chapters of the existence of
numerous prophets who differed from each other, and between
whose claims only the event could decide.</p>

<p>In the fourth section (chap. xxx.-xxxv.) Jeremiah prophesies
the restoration of Israel, and tells his readers how he bought a
field from his cousin on the strength of his hopes that the captivity
would have an end. A fifth part (chaps. xxxvi., xlv.)
relates to Baruch, Jeremiah's secretary; and an appendix (chap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582"> 582</span>
xxxvii.-xliv., and chap. xlvi. 13-28) contains historical matter,
and predictions about Egypt, but concludes with the usual
promise of the ultimate return of the Jewish nation to its ancestral
home.</p>

<p>The last chapter of Jeremiah is purely historical, and, like
the historical portions of Isaiah, need not be considered under
the prophets; but it must be noted that chaps. l. and li. are
not by Jeremiah, being the work of a much later writer, who
lived in Palestine, and who composed them to show that the
words of the genuine Jeremiah were fulfilled in the destruction
of Babylon by the Medes, which was taking place at this time
(P. A. B., vol. iii. p. 140 ff.). The small Book of Lamentations
over the unhappy fate of Jerusalem, ascribed to Jeremiah, is an
artistic attempt to embody the grief of the writer in a song of
which each verse begins with a new letter, in alphabetical
order.</p>

<p>We pass now to the prophet Ezekiel, a Jew who was taken
into captivity with Jehoiachin, and lived at a small town of
Mesopotamia. He felt the first prophetic impulses in the fifth
year of the Captivity (Ib., vol. ii. p. 322 ff.). At this time the
heavens were opened; he saw visions, and the word of the Lord
came expressly to him. Such was the nature of his consecration.
The first section of Ezekiel extends from chap. i. to xxiv.,
and contains utterances about Israel before the destruction of
Jerusalem. The second section (chap. xxv.-xxxii.) deals with
foreign nations, and the third (chap. xxxiii.-xlviii.) holds out
promises of restoration.</p>

<p>Ezekiel is very inferior to his great predecessors, Isaiah and
Jeremiah. He has neither the fervid, manly oratory of the first
nor the pathetic, though rather soft and feminine flow of the
second. He takes pleasure in rather coarse images, such as that
of the bread baked with human dung (Ezek. iv), that of Jehovah
with his two concubines, who bore him sons and vexed him
with their licentious conduct (Ezek. xxiii), or that of the child
whose navel was not cut, who grew up into a woman, over
whom Jehovah spread his skirt and covered her nakedness
(Ezek. xvi. 8). And in general, Ezekiel is particularly prone to
teaching by means of similes and illustrations. Sometimes he
sees visions in which God explains his meaning; at other times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583"> 583</span>
he acts in a manner which is designed to be typical of coming
events. Thus, on one occasion, he openly brings out his furniture
for removal, as a sign to the rebellious house of Israel
(Ezek. xii. 1-7).</p>

<p>As in Jeremiah, so in Ezekiel we find traces of hostility
towards rival prophets, whom he denounces in no measured
terms. It is interesting, too, to observe that there were female
prophets in his day, who prophesied out of their own hearts.
To them also he conveys the reprobation of the Almighty (Ezek.
xiii). The form in which he looks forward to the restoration of
Israel and Judah to their homes, is somewhat different from
that in which it was expected by his predecessors. In a very
singular vision, he relates that his God took him into a valley
which was full of bones, and told him that these were the
bones of the whole house of Israel. Ezekiel is then informed
that God will open the graves of the dead, and cause these
bones to live again, and will bring them to the land of Israel.
Afterwards, he is told to join two sticks into one, this junction
representing the future union of Ephraim and Judah, who are
to be gathered from among the heathen, and are to form one
nation governed by one king. That king is to be David, who
will be their prince forever. God will make an everlasting
covenant of peace with them, and put his sanctuary in their
midst for evermore. Here the resurrection of the dead, and
the return of David, instead of the appearance of a new king,
are peculiar features.</p>

<p>An anonymous prophet is supposed to have written Isaiah
xxi. 1-10, and another Isaiah xiii. 2-xiv. 23, the latter referring to
Babylon, and containing the imaginary exultation of the restored
Israelites over the fallen Babylonians. After these fragments
we have the work of one who is perhaps the greatest of all the
prophets, but who also is unknown to us by name. As the
most fitting description we may perhaps call him the anonymous
prophet. The whole of the latter portion of Isaiah, from
chap. xl. to the end, is his work. The anonymous prophet lived
in Egypt. His peculiar conception was that Israel was the servant
of the Lord for the peace and the salvation of nations, as
Kyros was his servant in war (P. A. B., vol. iii. p. 20 ff.). Alike
in beauty of language and sublimity of thought he is supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584"> 584</span>
among the writers of the Hebrew Bible. He is the prophet of
sorrow: yet also the prophet of consolation. Whether by a
curious accident, or whether by virtue of a tendency (not uncommon
among truly great writers) to withdraw his personality
from observation and confine himself wholly to the message he
had to deliver, he tells us nothing of himself. Hence he has for
centuries been hidden behind the figure of Isaiah, whom nevertheless
he surpasses in the purity of his ideal. To him we owe
the beautiful passage beginning "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my
people," with the description afterwards applied by Jesus
Christ to John the Baptist. From him also we have the most
exalted conceptions of the Messiah, the moral element in his
character being raised as compared with the element of material
power, to a height hitherto unexampled in prophetic vision.
Take, for instance, this description of his mildness combined
with indomitable perseverance:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the
street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he
not quench; he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not
fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth, and the
isles shall wait for his law" (Is. xlii. 2-4).</p>
</div>

<p>It is the anonymous prophet, too, who has given us the
familiar passage, "He is despised and rejected of men;" a passage
describing the career of a great man whose teachings involved
him in persecution and ultimately in martyrdom, but
nowise applicable to the Messiah. That a historical incident,
known to the writer, is alluded to in this touching account of
suffering goodness, admits of no reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>The anonymous prophet is preëminently the prophet of consolation.
Living in the days of Kyros and of the restoration of
the Temple, he had the elements of soothing speech ready to
his hand; and as his predecessors had prophesied destruction
and woe, occasionally varied with strains of hope, so he prophesies
in strains of hope, occasionally varied with sterner language.
It is his especial mission to heal the wounds that have
been made in the spirit of Judah. God had indeed forsaken her
for a while; but he will now take her back as a deserted wife,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585"> 585</span>
who had suffered her punishment. He had hidden his face in
a little wrath for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will
he now have mercy upon her (Is. liv. 5-7). The concluding
chapter of the anonymous prophet contains a magnificent description
of the ultimate gathering of all nations and tongues,
when Jerusalem will be the central point of human worship,
and the glory of God will be seen by all. The picture is not
indeed unmingled with darker shades, for great numbers are to
be destroyed by Jehovah in his indignation. On the other hand,
there is a trait exhibiting the superiority of this prophet to his
predecessors in toleration for the Gentiles: namely, the remarkable
prediction that some of them also are to be priests and
Levites (Is. lxvi. 12-24). The man who could utter this sentiment
had made a signal advance upon the ordinary narrow and
exclusive notions of the prerogatives of the Jewish race.</p>

<p>It was mentioned that the fiftieth and fifty-first chapters of
Jeremiah were added by a later hand. The same hand (in
Ewald's opinion) composed the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth
chapters of Isaiah, of which the second describes in very eloquent
terms the coming glory, when "the ransomed of the
Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting
joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and
sorrow and sighing shall flee away" (Is. xxxv. 10). Another
unknown writer (Isaiah xxiv.-xxvii.) predicts in the first place
the desolation which the Lord is about to effect, and then the
happiness of the Jews who will be brought to their own land
again, to worship Jehovah in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
One of his expressions, "He will swallow up death in victory,"
has been adopted by St. Paul; another, "The Lord God will
wipe away tears from off all faces," by the author of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>The interest of Haggai's prophecy is purely special: it refers
to the building of the temple at Jerusalem in the reign of
Darius. It was the unexpected obstacles by which the building
was hindered that kindled his zeal; he made his five speeches
in three months of the same year. Probably he had not seen
the first temple, and he left his prophetic work to his younger
contemporary Zechariah (P. A. B., vol. iii. p. 177 ff.).</p>

<p>Zechariah also lived in the time of Darius, and dealt princi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586"> 586</span>pally
with the building of the temple (Ib., vol. iii. p. 187 ff.). A
series of visions which he professes to see shows how his mind
was running upon this absorbing theme; and he even expects
the Messiah, whom Isaiah and Jeremiah had called a Branch
of David, and whom he more emphatically terms <i>the</i> Branch,
to appear at the head of affairs and to carry the works to their
completion (Zech., 8, and vi. 12). He supposes that he will then
sit and rule upon his throne; a priest will be beside him, and
there will be a counsel of peace between these two—the monarch
and his ecclesiastical minister (Zech., vi. 13).</p>

<p>It was probably more than half a century later that the
short book bearing the title of Malachi was written. The true
name of its author is unknown, and that of Malachi, my messenger,
was taken by its editor from the first verse of the third
chapter (P. A. B., vol. iii. p. 214 ff.). He is not a prophet of a
high calibre, as is shown by his denunciation, already quoted,
of those among the Jews who offered Jehovah their least valuable
cattle. Nor is his conception of the Messianic epoch in
any way comparable to that of the great prophets whose works
he might have studied. He says indeed that the Sun of righteousness
will arise with healing in his wings; but it appears
that this healing is to consist in the Israelites treading down
the wicked, who will be as dust under their feet. He concludes
by announcing the return of Elijah, before "the great and
dreadful day of the Lord," and says, in his threatening tone,
that this prophet will turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children, and of the children to the fathers, lest God should
come and smite the earth with a curse.</p>

<p>The Book of Jonah, which may have been written in the
fifth or sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> (P. A. B., vol. iii. p. 233 ff.), is a story
with a moral rather than a prophecy. Jonah was desired by
Jehovah to preach against Nineveh, but fled from his duty,
and took passage in the ship to Tarshish, duly paying his fare.
However, when a storm arose, Jonah knew that it was sent as a
penalty for his disobedience, and told the sailors to throw him
overboard. This they did, but he was swallowed alive by a large
fish prepared for the purpose, and remained within it three
days. By this lesson he was prepared to execute God's commands,
and was accordingly thrown up by the fish on dry land.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587"> 587</span>
He preached to the people of Nineveh, as desired, the coming
destruction of their city; but when they repented, Jehovah
changed his mind, much to the annoyance of his prophet, who
represented that his unfortunate tendency to clemency was the
very reason why he had not wished to enter his service. But
Jehovah, by causing him to regret the destruction of a gourd
which had sheltered him, showed him that there would be much
more reason to spare so large a city as Nineveh, which contained,
not only a vast population, but also a great deal of
cattle.</p>

<p>If Malachi and Jonah stand in unfavorable contrast to the
works composed during the golden age of Hebrew literature,
Daniel, the latest book of the Old Testament, represents the
complete degeneracy of prophecy. It is from beginning to end
artificial; professing to be written at one time and by an author
whose name and personality are given; in reality written at
another time, and by an author whose name and personality are
concealed. Hence it contains pseudo-prophecies, which are
comparatively clear, extending from the imagined date of the
supposed prophet to the actual date of the real prophet; and it
contains genuine prophecies which are obscure, and which extend
from the actual date into the actual future. It contains
also much that relates to the politics of the day, and which, for
obvious reasons, is cast into an enigmatic form. Daniel was
written about the year <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> 168, a little before the death of Antiochus
Epiphanes, and the allusions to that monarch are of
course made under the veil of prophecy, in a style designed to
be intelligible, without being direct. The predictions of the
eleventh chapter refer to the wars of the Syrian and Egyptian
kings, and especially to Antiochus Epiphanes, who is the "vile
person" mentioned in the twenty-first verse. The purpose of
the work was to set an example of fidelity to Jehovah to the
powerful Jews who were connected with the Syrian court, and
especially to the younger members of the great Jewish families,
who were in danger of being corrupted by its seductions (P. A.
B., vol. iii. p. 298 ff.).</p>

<p>The form chosen to effect the writer's object is autobiographical.
In this way he was able to utter his political views—which,
directly expressed, would have been dangerous to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588"> 588</span>
safety—under the guise of sentiments uttered by Daniel, the
fictitious narrator of the story. Daniel was taken as a captive
child along with other children of Jewish race to serve at the
court of Nebuchadnezzar, and remained at the Chaldean court
until the death of Nebuchadnezzar's son, Belshazzar, and the
subjugation of his empire by the Medes and Persians. He continued
to hold an honorable position at the Persian court under
Darius and Kyros. He first rose to distinction by relating and
interpreting to Nebuchadnezzar a dream which the king had
himself forgotten. Thus, from being a mere page he rose to be
a sort of astrologer royal. His life was not, however, free from
trouble. Among the children who had been brought with him
from Judea he had three friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
whom the Chaldeans called Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
When Daniel had successfully interpreted the king's
dream, he contrived to obtain lucrative situations in the province
of Babylon for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. But these
three having refused to worship a golden image which the king
had set up in that province were by the king's orders cast into
a burning fiery furnace, heated beyond its usual temperature.
But though they fell bound in the midst of it, they were not
burnt, and were seen walking about at their ease in it, accompanied
by a fourth, who looked like the Son of Man (Dan. iii).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that a precisely similar prodigy occurred in
one of the innumerable previous existences of the Buddha
Sakyamuni. He was at this time the son and heir of a great
king, and to prove his devotion to the true doctrine he literally
obeyed the instructions of a Brahman, who desired him to fill
a ditch ten yards deep with glowing coals and jump into it. On
this condition the Brahman had consented to teach him the
holy doctrine. Resisting all entreaties to preserve his life, the
prince caused the pool of fire to be prepared and leapt into it
without shrinking for a moment. On the instant it was converted
into a basin of flowers, and he appeared sitting on a
lotus-flower in its midst, while the gods caused a rain of flowers,
that rose knee-deep to fall upon the assembled people (G. O.
M., p. 14).</p>

<p>Nor is this the only other example of a wise discrimination
being exercised by the fiery element. During the reign of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589"> 589</span>
Indian king Asoka, who in the early part of his career was
ferocious and irreligious, the public executioner enjoyed the singular
privilege of being entitled to retain in his house every
one, whatever his position or character, who might cross the
threshold of his door. Now the outside of the executioner's
house was beautiful and attractive, though within it was full of
instruments of torture, with which he inflicted on his victims
the punishments of hell. One day a holy monk, named Samudra,
arriving at this apparently charming house, entered it, but
on discovering the nature of its interior wished to make his
exit. But it was too late. The executioner had seen him, and
told him that he must die. After seven days' respite, he threw
the monk into an iron caldron filled with water mixed with
loathsome materials, and kindled a fire below it. But the fire
would not burn. Far from experiencing any pain, the holy
man appeared calmly seated on a lotus. The executioner having
informed Asoka of this fact, the king arrived with a suite of
thousands of persons. Seeing this crowd, the monk darted into
the air, and there produced miraculous appearances. The king,
struck by the extraordinary sight, requested the ascetic to say
who he was, declaring that he honored him as a disciple. Samudra,
perceiving that the moment had arrived at which the
king was to receive the grace of instruction in the law, replied
that he was a son of Buddha, that merciful Being, and that he
was delivered from the bonds of existence. "And thou, O great
king, thy advent was predicted by Bhagavat, when he said: A
hundred years after I shall have entered into complete Nirvâna,
there will be in the town of Pataliputtra a king called Asoka, a
king ruling over the four quarters of the world, a just king,
who will distribute my relics," and so forth. He proceeded to
point out to Asoka the wickedness of establishing a house of
torment like that he was in, and entreated him to give security
to the beings who implored his compassion. Hereupon the king
accepted the law of Buddha, and determined to cover the earth
with monuments for his relics. But when the royal party were
about to leave the place, the executioner had the audacity to
remind Asoka of his promise that no one who had once entered
his doors might ever go out. "What," cried Asoka, "do you
wish then to put me also to death?" "Yes," replied the man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590"> 590</span>
On this he was seized and thrown into the torture-room, where
he died in the flames, and his house was destroyed (H. B. I., p.
365-372).</p>

<p>Daniel himself met with an adventure of the same perilous
nature as that which had befallen his three friends, though
under another government. Darius, by the advice of some
counselors who desired to destroy Daniel, had made an order
that no one should ask a petition of any god or man save himself
for thirty days. But Daniel of course continued to worship
Jehovah as before, and was sentenced in the terms of the edict
to be thrown into a lions' den. But the lions would no more
eat Daniel than the fire would burn his co-religionists; and
just as Asoka, when he had witnessed the escape of the ascetic,
worshiped Buddha, so Darius, having discovered Daniel uninjured
in the lions' den, immediately ordered that in all parts of
his dominions people should tremble and fear before the God of
Daniel (Dan. vi).</p>

<p>Of the prophecies contained in this book the most remarkable
is that concerning the Messiah, who is announced as destined
to come at a time fixed by a mystical calculation expressed in
weeks. The object of the writer was to fix a date for the Messiah's
appearance, without expressing himself in such unambiguous
terms as would be universally understood. Such is the
true method of prophecy in all religions, for a prophet who
utters his forecast of the future in such a manner as to render
his meaning unmistakable, exposes himself to the hazardous
possibility that the event in history may turn out altogether
unlike the event foretold.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 5.</span>—<i>The God of Israel.</i></h5>

<p>One great question has hitherto been left untreated—that of
the theology and morals of the Hebrew Bible. Theology and
morals are so intimately blended in its pages that the one can
scarcely be discussed without involving the other. The character
of Jehovah is the pattern of morality; his will is its fundamental
law; his actions its exemplification. Hence to consider
the character of Jehovah is of necessity to consider also the
Hebrew notions of ethics; while to inquire into the Hebrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591"> 591</span>
standard of ethics is to enquire into the commands of Jehovah.
Let us try then to ascertain what manner of deity Jehovah is.
To do so, our best course will be to select the salient features
of his history, as related by the sacred writers.</p>

<p>Now, at the very outset of his proceedings we observe that
he takes up towards mankind a very definite attitude: that of a
superior entitled to demand implicit obedience. Whether the
fact that he was man's creator justified so extensive a claim it
is needless in this place to discuss. Suffice it that he had the
power to enforce under the severest penalties the submission he
demanded. But it might have been expected that a divine
being, who assumed such unlimited rights over a race so vastly
his inferiors in knowledge and in strength, should at least exercise
them with discretion and moderation. It might have been
expected that where he claimed obedience it would be with a
view to the well-being of his creatures; not merely as an arbitrary
exercise of his enormous power. What, on the contrary, is
the conduct he pursued? His very first act after he had created
Adam and Eve and placed them in Paradise was to forbid them,
under penalty of death, to eat the fruit of a certain tree which
grew in their garden. There is not even a vestige of a pretense
in the narrative that the fruit of this tree would in itself, and
apart from the divine prohibition, have done them any harm.
Quite the contrary; the fact of eating it enlarged their faculties;
making them like gods, who know good and evil. And Jehovah
was afraid that they might, after eating the fruit of the tree of
knowledge, eat also that of the tree of life, after which he
would be unable to kill them. So that it was his deliberate
purpose in issuing this injunction to keep mankind feeble,
ignorant and dependent. Nor is this by any means the whole
extent of his misconduct. One of two charges he cannot escape.
Either he knew when he created Adam and Eve that their
nature was such that they would disobey, or he did not. In the
first case, he knowingly formed them liable to fall, knowingly
placed them amid conditions which rendered their fall inevitable;
and then punished them for the catastrophe he had all
along foreseen as the necessary result of the character he had
bestowed upon them. In the second case, he was ignorant and
shortsighted, being unable to guess what would be the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592"> 592</span>
of his own handiwork; and should not have meddled with
tasks which were obviously beyond the scope of his faculties.
And even in this latter case, the most favorable one for Jehovah,
he acted with unpardonable injustice towards the man and
woman in first creating them with a nature whose powers of
resistance to temptation he could not tell, then placing temptation,
raised to its utmost strength by a mysterious order, continually
under their noses, then allowing a serpent to suggest
that they should yield to it, and lastly punishing the unhappy
victims of this chain of untoward circumstances by expulsion
from their garden. A human parent who should thus treat his
children would be severely and justly censured. It is a striking
proof how rudimentary were the Hebrew conceptions of justice,
that they should have accepted, in reference to their deity, a
story which evinces so flagrant a disregard of its most elementary
requirements (Gen. ii. 8, and iii). Just as in the case of
Adam and Eve, he required implicit obedience to an arbitrary
command, so in the case of Abraham he required implicit obedience
to an immoral one. There was with him no fixed system
of morality. Submission to his will was the alpha and omega
of virtue. Observe now how superior is the feeling shown in
the Hindu legend which has been quoted as a parallel to that of
the projected sacrifice of Isaac. Although in that story the
father was bound by a solemn promise to sacrifice his son, yet
he is never blamed for his reluctance to do so, though Abraham
is praised for his willingness; while the Brahman who is
actually prepared to plunge the sacrificial knife into his child's
breast is treated with scorn and reprobation for his unfeeling
behavior. Even the service of the gods is not made supreme
over every human emotion. But the conception of the existence
of duties independent of the divine will seems not to have
entered the minds of the Hebrew theologians who wrote these
books.</p>

<p>The further proceedings of Jehovah are quite in keeping
with his beginning in the garden of Eden. Throughout the
whole course of the history he shows the most glaring partiality.
In its earlier period he is partial to individuals; in its
later, to the Hebrew race. Let us notice a few cases of this
favoritism as shown towards individual favorites. Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593"> 593</span>
after the curse upon Adam and Eve, and their banishment from
Eden, we have the instructive story of Cain and Abel, so magnificently
dramatized by Byron. These two brothers, sons of
the original couple, both brought offerings to Jehovah; Cain,
the fruit of the ground; Abel, the firstlings of his flock. But
the Lord had respect to Abel and his offering, but not to Cain
and his offering. Why was this difference made? Absolutely
no reason is assigned for it, and it is not surprising, however
lamentable, that it should have excited the jealousy of the
brother who was thus ill-treated (Gen. iv. 1-8). Again, it has
been remarked above that Abraham and Isaac had a singular
way of passing off their wives as their sisters. Pharaoh was
once deceived in this way about Sarah; Abimelech of Gerar,
once about Sarah, and once about Rebekah. These two monarchs
were plagued by Jehovah on account of their innocent
mistake; the patriarchs were not even reproved for this cowardly
surrender of their consorts to adulterous embraces (Gen.
xii. 11-20, xx., xxvi. 7-11). Jacob is another favorite, while his
brother Esau is coldly treated. Yet the inherent meanness of
Jacob's character, and the comparative excellence of Esau's,
are too obvious to escape even a careless reader. What can be
more pitiful than the conduct of Jacob in taking advantage of
a moment of weakness in his brother to purchase his birthright?
(Gen. xxv. 29-34.) What more ungenerous than the odious trick
by which he imposed upon his father, and cheated Esau of his
blessing? (Gen. xxvii.) What again can be more magnanimous
than the long subsequent reception by Esau of the brother
whose miserable subserviency showed his consciousness of the
wrong he had done him? (Gen. xxxiii. 1-15). Yet this is the
man whom Jehovah selects as the object of his peculiar blessing,
and whose very deceitfulness towards a kind employer he
suffers to become a means of aggrandizement (Gen. xxx. 41-43).</p>

<p>The same partisanship which in these cases forms so conspicuous
a trait in the character of Jehovah distinguishes the
whole course of his proceedings in reference to the delivery of
the Israelites from Egypt and their settlement in Palestine.
Every other nation is compelled to give way for their advantage.
Pharaoh and all the Egyptians are plagued for holding them in
slavery, not in the least because Jehovah was an abolitionist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594"> 594</span>
(for he never troubled himself about slavery anywhere else), but
because it was his own peculiar people who were thus in subjugation
to a race whom he did not equally affect. Throughout
the long journey from Egypt to the promised land, Jehovah
accompanies the Israelites as a sort of commander-in-chief,
directing them what to do, and giving them the victory over
their enemies. As the Red Sea was divided to enable them to
escape from their enemies on the one side, so the Jordan was
cleft in two to enable them to conquer their enemies on the
other (Ex. xiv. 21, 22.—Josh. iii. 7-17). The walls of a fortified
city were thrown down to enable them to enter (Josh. vi. 20).
The sun was arrested in his course to enable them to win a
battle (Josh. x. 12-14). Hornets were employed to accomplish
the expulsion of hostile tribes without trouble to the Israelites
(Josh. xxiv. 12). Thus, as Jehovah afterwards took care to remind
them, he gave them a land for which they did not labor,
and cities which they did not build (Josh. xxiv. 13).</p>

<p>Nevertheless the lot of the race who were thus highly
favored was far from happy. Their God was indeed a powerful
protector, but he was also an exacting ruler. His service was
at no time an easy one, and he was liable to outbursts of passion
which rendered it peculiarly oppressive. Tolerant as he
might be towards some descriptions of immorality, he had no
mercy whatever for disloyalty towards himself. On one occasion
he characterized himself by the name of "Jealous" (Ex. xxxiv.
14), which was but too appropriate, and implied the possession
of one of the least admirable of human weaknesses. Now the
Israelites were unfortunately prone to lapses of this kind. Such
was the severity with which these offenses were treated that it
is questionable whether it would not have been a far happier
fate to be drowned in the Red Sea with the Egyptians than
preserved with the children of Israel. A few instances of what
they had to undergo will illustrate this remark.</p>

<p>Moses had impressed upon the people the importance of
having no other deity but Jehovah, and had succeeded while he
was actually among them in restricting them to his worship
alone. But no sooner was he absent for a season than they
immediately forsook Jehovah, and took to worshiping a golden
calf. Worst of all, this new divinity was set up by Aaron, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595"> 595</span>
brother of Moses, and high priest of the Jehovistic faith. That
Jehovah should be rather vexed at such ungrateful behavior,
after all the trouble he had taken in plaguing and slaughtering
the Egyptians, was only natural; but it was surely an extraordinary
want of self-control to propose to consume the whole
nation at once, reserving only Moses as the progenitor of a better
race. Here, as in other cases, Moses showed himself more
merciful than his God. He ingeniously urged as a motive to
clemency that the Egyptians would say extremely unpleasant
things if the Israelites were destroyed; and after his return to
the camp he contrived to appease him by inducing the Levites
to perpetrate a fratricidal massacre, whereby three thousand
people fell. This measure was described by Moses as a consecration
of themselves to the Lord, that he might bestow his
blessing upon them. It proved successful, for Jehovah now
contented himself with merely plaguing the people instead of
exterminating them (Ex. xxxii). Thus, he had scarcely finished
plaguing the Egyptians before he began plaguing the Israelites
in their turn. Indeed he was at this period peculiarly prone to
sending plagues of one kind or another. Some complaints of
the Israelites in the wilderness were visited by fire which burnt
up those who were at the extremities of the camp (Num. xi.
1-3). When they began to pine for the varied food they had
enjoyed in Egypt, and to lament the absence of flesh meat, he
sent them quails indeed, but accompanied the gift with a very
great plague, of which large numbers perished (Num. xi. 4-34).
When they were dismayed by the reports brought them concerning
the inhabitants of Palestine, and complained of their
God for the position he had brought them into, he again fell
into a rage and proposed to destroy them all by pestilence
except Moses. But Moses a second time appealed to him on
what seems to have been his weak side,—his regard for his
reputation among the Egyptians. These had all heard of what
he had been doing, and would not they and the other neighboring
nations ascribe the destruction of the Israelites in the wilderness
to his inability to bring them into the promised land?
Moved by this reasoning, Jehovah consented to spare the people,
but determined at the same time to avenge himself upon
them by not permitting any of those that had come from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596"> 596</span>
Egypt (except Joshua and Caleb, who had reported in the proper
spirit about Palestine) to set foot within the country to which
he had solemnly engaged himself to conduct them (Num. xiv.
1-39). Thus, they were only saved from the Egyptians to perish
in the wilderness. Truly, the tender mercies of the Lord were
cruel.</p>

<p>But the miseries of these unfortunate wanderers were by no
means ended. When, oppressed by the troubles and weariness
of the way, they dared to murmur, and inquired of Moses why
he had brought them out of Egypt to die in the wilderness,
where there was neither tolerable bread, nor water, the resentment
of Jehovah was excited by this audacity. They ought to
have been only too grateful that they had remained alive.
Jehovah had not caused the earth to swallow them as it had
done Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their wives and little
children, because they had ventured to complain of the government
of Moses; nor had he destroyed them by plague, as he
had destroyed 14,700 people because there had been some expressions
of dissatisfaction at the sudden death of those seditious
men. If then they had hitherto escaped destruction, they were
certainly foolish in complaining of the hardships of the desert.
At any rate Jehovah soon convinced them that their grumbling
was useless. No constitutional opposition was permitted in
those days. Fiery serpents were despatched to bite them, and
many of them died in consequence. Such was the extent of
the calamity that Moses, always more merciful than his God,
interceded for his people; and was directed to set up a brazen
serpent, by looking at which the bites of the living serpents
were healed (Num. xxi. 1-9).</p>

<p>The extraordinary cruelty ascribed by the Hebrews to their
national deity is shown in many other instances besides those
that have been mentioned. And it is to be noticed that it is
cruelty mingled with caprice. No one could tell beforehand
precisely what actions he would visit with punishment, nor
what would be the punishment with which he would visit them.
Everything with him was uncertain. He had no fixed system of
laws at all, and he sometimes condemned a criminal in virtue
of <i>ex post facto</i> legislation. The deluge is an example of all
these vices combined. It was an excessively cruel punishment;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597"> 597</span>
it was inflicted capriciously, and once in a way only, because
God had changed his mind as to the propriety of having created
man; and it was the result of a resolution arrived at after the
offenses it was designed to chastise had already been committed.
No human being could possibly have guessed beforehand
that his crimes would be punished in that particular way. And
after the crimes of the antediluvians had been thus punished,
the survivors received a promise that no misconduct on their
part would ever be visited upon them in the same way. So that
any conceivable utility which the deluge might have had as a
warning for the future was utterly destroyed. Equal caprice,
though not equal cruelty, was shown towards the builders of
the tower of Babel, who were suffered to begin their labors
without hindrance, but were afterwards stopped by the confusion
of their languages. Why it was wrong to erect such a
tower is never stated. Could any of those engaged upon it have
guessed that the attempt was one deserving of punishment?
Still worse was Jehovah's behavior to the prophet Balaam, for
he first ordered him to go with the men who were sent for
him, and then was angry with him because he went (Num. xxii.
20, 22). Such conduct was on a level with that of a pettish
woman. Instances of barbarous severity may be found in
abundance. Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, were devoured
by "fire from the Lord," because they had taken their censers,
and offered strange fire before him (Lev. x. 1, 2). A man who
on the father's side was Egyptian, was ordered to be stoned for
blaspheming and cursing the name of the Lord; Jehovah being
peculiarly eager in avenging personal affronts (Lev. xxiv. 10-16).
On this occasion no doubt a general law was announced affixing
the penalty of stoning to the offense of blasphemy; but the
law was <i>ex post facto</i> so far as the individual who suffered by
its operation was concerned. On another occasion the heads of
the people were ordered to be all hung for whoredom with the
daughters of Moab, and for idolatry. Phinehas, Aaron's son,
seeing an Israelite with a Midianitish woman, ran then both
through the body with a javelin; for which heroic exploit
against an unprepared man and a defenseless woman he was
specially praised; was declared to have turned away God's
wrath from Israel, and received a "covenant of peace" for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598"> 598</span>
himself and his posterity (Num. xxv. 1-15). At a much later
period, when David was causing the ark to be brought back
from the Philistines, an unfortunate man who had put out his
hand to touch it because the oxen shook it, was immediately
slain; an act at which even the pious David was displeased, and
which caused him, not unnaturally, to be "afraid before the
Lord that day" (2 Sam. vi. 6-9). In the reign of Jeroboam a
prophet who had only been guilty of the involuntary error of
believing another prophet who had told him a falsehood, was
killed by a lion sent expressly for his punishment, while the
man who had deceived him escaped scot free (1 Kings xiii. 1-32).
Another man suffered for refusing to obey the word of a prophet
what this one had suffered for obeying it. Being desired by one
of the "sons of the prophets" to smite him so as to cause a
wound, and having declined the office, he was informed that for
his disobedience to the voice of the Lord he would be slain by
a lion, which accordingly happened (1 Kings xx. 35, 36). Mercy
towards a conquered enemy was sometimes an actual crime.
Because he spared Agag, Saul was rejected from being king
over Israel, and the Lord repented that he had appointed so
weak-minded a man. Samuel, who was made of sterner stuff,
had no scruple in carrying out the behests of his God, for he
"hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord" (1 Sam. xv). In like
manner Ahab was reproved for sparing the life of Ben-hadad,
King of Syria (1 Kings xx. 42, 43). The same monarch whose
leniency had thus brought him into trouble was afterwards the
victim of a sanguinary fraud practiced upon him by Jehovah.
Tired of his reign, and eager to effect his destruction, the Lord
put a lying spirit into the mouth of all his prophets, who were
thus induced to prophesy victory in an engagement which actually
terminated in his defeat and death (1 Kings xxii. 1-40).
Observe, that however foolish Ahab may have been in believing
the false prophets and disbelieving Micaiah, this does not
excuse Jehovah, who according to his own chosen spokesman,
deliberately arranged this scheme for the overthrow of the king
in the court of heaven. Other barbarous deeds followed upon
this. To gratify Elijah, a hundred men who were guiltless of
any crime whatever, were consumed by fire (2 Kings i. 9-12). To
assuage the wounded vanity of Elisha, forty-two little children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599"> 599</span>
were eaten by bears (2 Kings ii. 23, 24). To maintain the glory
of the true God, Elijah slaughtered the prophets of Baal to the
number of many hundreds (1 Kings xviii. 17-40). To reëstablish
the orthodox faith, Jehu got rid of the worshipers of Baal, collected
together by an infamous trick, in one indiscriminate massacre;
an atrocity for which he was specially praised and
rewarded by "the Lord" (2 Kings x. 18-30).</p>

<p>It is needless to prolong the list of cruelties practiced upon
private individuals. But the subject would be incompletely
treated, did we not observe that the same spirit prevailed in the
dealings of Jehovah with nations. Thus, when the Israelites
were about to enter the land of Canaan, they were desired
utterly to destroy the seven nations who possessed it already
(Deut. vii. 2). When they captured Jericho, they slew all its
inhabitants, young and old, except the household of the prostitute
with whom their messengers had lodged, and who had
shamelessly betrayed her countrymen. Her, with her family
they saved (Josh. vi. 1-25). All the inhabitants of Ai were
utterly destroyed (Josh. viii. 26). All the inhabitants of Makkedah
were utterly destroyed (Josh. x. 28). All the inhabitants
of many other places were utterly destroyed (Josh. x. 29-43, and
xi. 11, 14). One city alone made peace with Israel; all the rest
were taken in battle, and that because Jehovah had deliberately
and of set purpose hardened the hearts of their inhabitants,
that they might be utterly destroyed (Josh. xi. 20).</p>

<p>Such a catalogue of crimes—and the number is by no means
exhausted—would be sufficient to destroy the character of any
pagan divinity whatsoever. I fail to perceive why the Jews
alone should be privileged to represent their God as guilty of
such actions without suffering the inference which in other
cases would undoubtedly be drawn—namely, that their conceptions
of deity were not of a very exalted order, nor their principles
of morals of a very admirable kind. There is, indeed,
nothing extraordinary in the fact that, living in a barbarous
age, the ancient Hebrews should have behaved barbarously.
The reverse would rather be surprising. But the remarkable
fact is, that their savage deeds, and the equally savage ones
attributed to their God, should have been accepted by Christendom
as flowing in the one case from the commands, in the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600"> 600</span>
from the immediate action of a just and beneficent Being.
When the Hindus relate the story of Brahma's incest with his
daughter, they add that the god was bowed down with shame
on account of his subjugation by ordinary passion (O. S. T., vol.
i. p. 112). But while they thus betray their feeling that even a
divine being is not superior to all the standards of morality, no
such consciousness is ever apparent in the narrators of the passions
of Jehovah. While far worse offenses are committed by
him, there is no trace in his character of the grace of shame.</p>

<p>Turning now to the legislation which emanated from him, we
shall find evidence of the same spirit which has been seen to
mark his daily dealings. It is impossible here to examine that
legislation in detail, and it may be freely conceded that much of
it was well adapted to the circumstances under which it was
delivered. Some of the precepts given are indeed trivial, such as
the order to the Israelites not to round the corners of their
heads, nor mar the corners of their beards (Lev. xix. 27), and
others are [such as are] merely special to the Hebrew religion.
But the mass of enactments may very probably have been wise,
or, at least, not conspicuously the reverse. Those to which the
chief exception must be taken, are such as demonstrate the
essentially inhuman character of the authority from whom they
emanated. Thus, death is the penalty affixed to the insignificant
offense of Sabbath-breaking (Ex. xxxv. 2). If the nearest relation,
or even the wife of his bosom, or the friend who is as his
own soul, secretly entice a man to go and worship other gods,
he himself is to put the tempter to death, his own hand being
the first to fling the stones by which he is to perish (Deut. xiii.
6-11). The Inquisition itself could have no more detestable law
than this. If it is a city that is guilty of such heresy, it is to
be burnt down, and all its inhabitants put to the sword (Deut.
xiii. 12-16). The mere worship of pagan divinities, apart from
any effort to seduce others, is likewise punished with stoning
(Deut. xvii. 2-7). In cities not in Palestine, taken in war, all the
males only are to be put to death; but in the cities of Palestine
itself, nothing that breathes is to be saved alive (Deut. xx.
13-18). A "stubborn and rebellious son" may be put to death
by stoning, and that at the instance of his parents (Deut. xxi.
18-21). In appearance this terrible process for dealing with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601"> 601</span>
naughty boy is less severe than the <i>patria potestas</i> of the Romans,
by which the power of life and death was lodged in the
father alone. Practically, however, the exercise of this unlimited
<i>legal</i> right was prevented to a large extent, for a religious curse
rested on the father who even sold his married son, and he
could not pronounce sentence on any child till after consulting
the nearest blood-relations on both sides, without incurring the
same anathema (Mommsen, History of Rome, vol. i. p. 65). No
doubt the purely legal power of the head of the family was unaffected
by these restraints. Human authority still permitted
him to expose his children at birth, to sell them, or to sentence
them to death. But the difference between Roman and Jewish
institutions was, that in Rome, religion sought to mitigate the
cruelty of the civil law; in Palestine, religion not only did nothing
to soften, but positively sanctioned, by its august commands
the most revolting enactments of barbaric legislation. It is
true that no instance is known to history of the employment of
this law by Jews against their children, but this can only show
that their parental morality was superior to the morality of the
divine law. At a much later time than that at which this
enactment was given, when the Israelites returned from the
Captivity, the same harsh and intolerant spirit as we have
observed in their earlier legislation broke forth again. By a
cruel measure, enacted by Ezra, the representative of Jehovah,
and taking the form of a covenant with God, the people were
forced to repudiate all their wives who were not of pure Israelitish
blood (Ezra ix, and x). Nehemiah, who was likewise zealous
in the service of Jehovah, was no less an enemy to "outlandish
women," and took rather strong measures against those
who had married them, such as cursing them, smiting them,
plucking off their hair, and making them swear not to give
their sons or daughters in marriage to foreigners (Neh. xiii.
23-28).</p>

<p>Such being the moral characteristics of the Hebrew God, can
it be said that the intellectual ideas of the divine nature found
in the Old Testament are of a highly refined and spiritual
order? On the contrary, as compared with the gods of other
races, Jehovah is remarkably anthropomorphic and materialistic.
He does not approach in spirituality to the higher con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602"> 602</span>ceptions
of the Hindus, nor is he even equal to those of less
subtle and speculative nations. He is on a level with the gods
of popular mythologies, but not with those more mysterious
powers who often stand above them. The evidence of this
proposition is to be found in the whole tenor of the historical
books. Thus, in the very beginning of Genesis, we find that he
"rested on the seventh day," (Gen. ii. 2) as if he were a being
altogether apart from the forces of nature, and might leave the
world to go on without him. A little later he is found "walking
in the garden in the cool of the day" (Gen. iii. 8). He
clearly had a body resembling that of man, for on one occasion
Moses was so highly favored as to be permitted to see his
"back parts," and was covered with his hand while he was
passing by. His face Moses was not permitted to behold, as it
would have caused his death (Ex. xxxiii. 20-23). In order to
pass by he "descended" in a cloud, implying local habitation,
and at this time he magniloquently proclaimed his own titles
and virtues, which he might more gracefully have employed an
angel to do for him. Elsewhere it is stated that Moses and the
elders "saw the God of Israel," and that he had some sort of
paved work of sapphire stone under his feet. When Moses
went up alone into the mount, "the sight of the glory of the
Lord was like devouring fire." God was at this time supposed
to be on the mount, and there held discourse with Moses (Ex.
xxiv. 10-25). In the course of it he says that he will "commune"
from above the mercy-seat in the tabernacle, again (as
in so many other places) implying occupation of definite space
(Ex. xxv. 22). He promises to "dwell among the children of
Israel," that is, to be a national and local God (Ex. xxix. 45,
46). Confirmation of the view here taken of his limited nature
is found in the fact that he thought it necessary to "go down"
to Sodom and Gomorrah, to verify the reports which had
reached him concerning the conduct of their inhabitants. And
when Abraham appealed to him for mercy for those of them
who were righteous, his several answers clearly implied that
when he went to those cities he would discover how many of
them came under that denomination. "If I find in Sodom fifty
righteous," and so forth, is the language of one who does not
know a fact, but is going to ascertain it. And accordingly at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603"> 603</span>
the end of the colloquy "the Lord went his way" (Gen. xviii.
20-33). So completely anthropomorphic is the conception of
deity that, although the expression occurs only in a parable, it
is not at variance with the mode in which he is usually spoken
of when wine is said "to cheer God and man" (Judg. ix. 13).
Evidently there was nothing shocking to the Hebrew mind in
such an expression. And when they pictured their God as
walking, talking, indignant, angry, repenting, jealous, showing
himself to human beings, and generally indulging in the passions
of mortals, it was perfectly easy to conceive that wine
might exercise the same effect on him as it did on them.</p>

<p>No doubt the Hebrew mythology is free from all that class
of stories in which a divine being is represented as making love
to or cohabiting with women. Or, to speak more accurately,
they never represent Jehovah himself as indulging in such
amusements. There is a reminiscence of this form of myth in
the statement that before the deluge the sons of God intermarried
with the daughters of men (Gen. vi. 2); but their supreme
Being was free at least from sexual passion. So far as it goes,
this is well; but if I had to choose between a God who was
somewhat licentious in his relations with mankind, and one
who did not stick at deeds of bloodshed of the most outrageous
character, I confess I should see no very powerful reason to
prefer the latter.</p>

<p>That, in spite of all these drawbacks, there are some better
elements in the Hebrew ideal I do not at all deny. The poetical
description of God as a "still small voice" is both eloquent
and spiritual; and the prayer of Solomon, with its admission
that the heaven of heavens cannot contain the Infinite Power
who is entreated to dwell in the Temple, is in many respects
beautiful and admirable. So also the views of Jehovah attained
and uttered by some of the prophets are far loftier than those
generally expressed in the historical books. Many of the
Psalms, again, are full of beauty in the manner in which they
speak of him to whom they are addressed. In a nation so
deeply religious as the Jews, and so much given to meditation
on God, it was inevitable that the higher class of minds should
conceive him more spiritually than the lower, and it is this
class to whom we owe the poetical and prophetic writings. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604"> 604</span>
was inevitable also that as civilization advanced, the grosser
elements of the conception, which belonged to a barbarous people,
should be eliminated, and that the finer ones should
remain. The entire supersession of the older God by the newer
was prevented by the fact that the Old Testament was a sacred
book, and that hence every one of its statements had to be
received as absolutely true. The inconsistency between the
wrathful monarch of ancient times and the loving Spirit of
more recent ages was sought to be surmounted by those processes
of interpretation which have been shown to be invariably
adopted when it is desired to bring the infallible Scriptures
of any nation into harmony with the opinions of their readers.
But happily the language of the historical portions of the Old
Testament is singularly plain, and no ingenious manipulation
of the text can with the smallest plausibility put aside the obvious
meaning of the broad assertions on which is founded the
above delineation of the God of Israel.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Section VIII.</span>—<span class="smcap">The New Testament.</span></h4>

<p>Since a considerable portion of the New Testament has
already been dealt with in the life of Jesus, we have only, in
the present section, to consider the remaining works of which
it is composed. These will not require a very elaborate treatment.
They consist of one historical book, continuing the history
of the Christian community from the death of its founder
till the imprisonment of Paul at Rome, of letters, partly genuine,
partly spurious, bearing the names of eminent apostles as
their authors, and of one composition somewhat akin in its
nature to the writings of the Hebrew prophets. Of these several
parts of the New Testament (excluding the Gospels) some
of the Epistles are probably the most ancient; but as it would
be difficult to establish any precise chronological sequence
among the several books, it will be most convenient to begin
with that which stands first in actual order.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 1.</span>—<i>The Acts of the Apostles.</i></h5>

<p>The author of the third gospel, having written the life of
Jesus, proceeded to compose, in addition to it, a history of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605"> 605</span>
proceedings of his apostles after his decease. We are greatly
indebted to him for having done so, for this book is, notwithstanding
some extravagances, of considerable value, and is the
most trustworthy of the five historical books in the New Testament.
It brought the narrative of events nearer to the date at
which it was written than the gospel could do, and it dealt with
events concerning which better evidence was accessible to the
writer. There was thus not the same scope for fiction as there
had been in the life of Christ. Nevertheless the story of the
Acts of the Apostles is by no means free from legendary admixture.</p>

<p>Beginning with the ascension, which has been already noticed
in connection with the gospel, it proceeds to relate the choice
of a new apostle in place of the unfaithful Judas. The ceremony
by which the choice was made evinces a singular superstition
on the part of the apostles. Having selected two men,
Joseph and Matthias, they simply prayed that God would show
which he had chosen. They then drew lots, and the lot fell
upon Matthias (Acts i. 15-26).</p>

<p>The next important event in the history of the Church thus
recruited, was the reception of the Holy Ghost on the day of
Pentecost. On this occasion the Christians were all assembled,
when suddenly there was a sound like that of strong wind;
cloven tongues appeared and sat upon them; they were filled
with the Holy Ghost, and suddenly acquired the power of
speaking foreign languages (Acts ii. 1-13). Since the "gift of
tongues" has not been unknown in certain communities in
recent times, we might perhaps form a tolerably correct notion
from the reports of modern observers as to what the scene
among the disciples was like. Even, however, without this
modern experience, we should not be altogether in the dark as
to the character of the phenomenon of which the author
of the Acts makes mention. For although it is indeed stated that some
of the strangers who were present heard each his own language
spoken by the disciples, it is added that the conviction produced
upon others was that the Christians were drunk. It
must have been a wild and singular exhibition which could
lead to the formation of such an opinion. But if we wanted
further explanation we should find it in the words of Paul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606"> 606</span>
whose strong practical judgment led him to depreciate the value
of the gift of tongues as compared with that of preaching.
Had this gift consisted in the power of speaking their own languages
to foreign nations, there is none to whom it would have
been of greater service than the apostle of the Gentiles. Yet
it is he who tells us that at a meeting he would rather speak
five words with his understanding, that he might teach others
also, than ten thousand in a tongue. So that the words spoken
"in tongues" were not spoken with the understanding; they
were mere sounds without a meaning to him who uttered them.
Equally clear is the evidence of Paul to the fact that they were
without a meaning to him who heard them. His reason for desiring
his correspondents to cultivate the gift of prophesying
(or preaching) rather than that of tongues is that "he that
speaks in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God, for <i>nobody</i>
understands him, but in the spirit he speaks mysteries. But he
that preaches speaks to men edification, and exhortation, and
comfort. He that speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but he
that preaches edifies the Church" (1 Cor. xiv. 2-4). Tongues, he
says further on, are for a sign to unbelievers; that is, they are
of use merely to impress the senses of those whose minds cannot
yet be appealed to. But if the unbelieving or unlearned
should happen to enter a meeting where the disciples were all
speaking with tongues, they would consider them mad: a
striking testimony to the tumultuous character of scenes like
that presented by the enthusiastic assembly of the Christians
at Pentecost. Hence Paul desires that two, or at most three,
should speak with tongues at a time, and that there should
always be somebody to interpret, in other words, to translate
nonsense into sense. Without an interpreter, he would not
sanction any exercise of this peculiar faculty on the part of the
inspired linguist (1 Cor. xiv. 1-28).</p>

<p>To satisfy the doubts of those who attributed the sudden
attainments of the apostles to intoxicating drinks, Peter delivered
a discourse, which ended in the addition of 3,000 members
to the rising sect. It is remarkable that these new members at
once became communists, both they and all the disciples having
all things in common; a noteworthy indication of what was
required by the religion of Christ as understood by his immedi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607"> 607</span>ate
disciples (Acts ii. 14-47). Further evidence, if any were
needed, of the communistic character of the Church is contained
at the end of the fourth chapter, while the fifth informs us of
the tolerably severe measures taken to enforce it. "There was
one heart and one soul among the multitude of those who
believed, nor did a single one say that any of the things he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common."
Unhappily the one heart and one mind did not extend to Ananias
or to his wife Sapphira, for this naughty couple "sold a possession
and kept back part of the price." But Peter was not
thus to be taken in. It does not appear from the account that
Ananias was asked whether the sum he produced was the
whole price of the land, or that he told any falsehood regarding
it. However, Peter remarked that he might have kept either
the property or its price, had he thought proper, and charged
him with lying to God; whereupon the poor man fell down
dead. About three hours later, Sapphira came in; and she distinctly
stated that the sum produced by Ananias was the full
price. Peter told her that the feet of those who had buried her
husband were at the door, and would carry her out too. She
then fell down at his feet, and expired in her turn (Acts. iv.
31-v. 11).</p>

<p>No wonder that "great fear came upon all the Church"
when they heard these things. Peter's proceedings were indeed
alarming, and could we for a moment accept the account of his
historian, we should have no option but to hold him guilty of
the wilful murder of Sapphira. He knew, according to his own
statement, what the effect of his words upon this woman would
be, and he should have abstained from any expression that
could bring about so terrible a catastrophe. Happily, we may
reject the whole story as either a fiction or a perversion of fact.
Had it been true, it would have called for very much sterner
measures than those taken by the Sanhedrim, who, having
already desired Peter and John to keep silence about the new
religion, now merely imprisoned the apostles, and afterwards, on
the prudent advice of Gamaliel, determined to release them;
not indeed till after they had beaten them and again prohibited
their propagandist efforts (Acts v. 17-42). It is interesting to
observe that Luke effects the deliverance of the apostles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608"> 608</span>
prison by the intervention of an angel, and that at a later
period, when Peter had been imprisoned by Herod, he again
gets him out by means of an angel who appears to him while
sleeping, and at whose presence his chains fall off (Acts xii.
1-19). This is quite in accordance with the proceedings of the
same author in the gospel, where his partiality for angels as
part of his theatrical machinery has been shown to be characteristic.</p>

<p>The infant community was now increasing in numbers, and
along with this increase there arose the customary consequences—dissension
and mutual distrust. We are fortunate in possessing
in the Acts an account of the very first quarrel in the
Church; the earliest symptom of those discords and hostilities,
which, since that time, have so incessantly raged within her
limits. It was on a question of money; the Greeks murmuring
against the Hebrews, because they thought their widows were
neglected in the daily ministration. The apostles tided over
the immediate difficulty by appointing subordinate officers to
attend to matters of business. The plan succeeded; but their
peace was soon to be disturbed again by graver questions (Acts
vi. 1-8).</p>

<p>Among those appointed to superintend the pecuniary interests
of the Church was one named Stephen. This man is reported
to have performed great wonders and miracles, but some of the
Jews accused him of blasphemy, and after an eloquent defense,
which to Jewish ears amounted to an admission of the charge,
he was sentenced to death by stoning. Foremost in the execution
of the sentence was a man named Saul, who was conspicuous
at this time for the bitterness with which he pursued the
Christians, entering their private houses, and causing them to
be imprisoned (Acts vi. 9-viii. 3).</p>

<p>If any proof were needed of the entire conscientiousness of
the Jewish persecutors of Christianity at this time we should
find it in the character of Saul. Of the honesty of his religious
zeal, of the single-minded sense of duty from which he acted in
his anti-Christian period, his subsequent career makes it impossible
to entertain a doubt. Men like the apostle Paul are not
made out of selfish, dishonest, or cruel natures. He was at the
martyrdom of Stephen as honorable and fearless an upholder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609"> 609</span>
the ancient faith as he was afterwards to the new. He himself
several times refers in his writings to his persecution of the
Church, and always in the tone of a man who had nothing to be
ashamed of but a mistake in judgment. As touching the righteousness
which is in the law, he tells us he was blameless (Phil.
iii. 6). And although in intellectual power he was doubtless
above the average of his class, in point of genuine devotion to
his creed, he may fairly be taken as a type of the men with
whom he consented to act.</p>

<p>Saul had probably been impressed by the conduct of the
Christians, whom he had so ruthlessly delivered up to justice.
At any rate the subject of the Christian religion had taken great
hold upon his mind, for on his way to Damascus he saw a vision
which induced him to become himself a follower of Jesus.
It is unfortunate that we have no detailed account of the nature
of the event which led to his conversion from Paul himself.
He often alludes to it, but nowhere describes it.</p>

<p>The most important passage bearing upon the subject is in
the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, where he thus mysteriously
refers to his experience on this occasion: "I knew a man
in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do
not know, whether out of the body I do not know) such an one
caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man
(whether in the body, whether out of the body, God knows),
that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter" (2 Cor. xii. 2-4).
So far as it goes, this account does not very well agree with
that of the Acts, since there we are told exactly what were the
words Paul heard, and what he answered. We are left in doubt
then whether the conversation between Christ and the apostle
there related rests on the authority of Paul himself, or represents
merely the imagination of others as to what might have
passed between them. But that Paul saw some kind of vision,
which he himself believed to be a vision of Christ, there can be
no doubt.</p>

<p>From Luke we have two versions of this incident, one in the
form of historical narrative, the other in that of a speech put
into the mouth of Paul. According to these he saw a light, and
heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610"> 610</span>
On inquiry, he learnt that the voice emanated from Jesus, and
he was desired to proceed to Damascus, where further instructions
would be given him. Luke has not taken sufficient pains
to make his two versions harmonize, for in the first we are told
that his companions heard a voice, but saw no man; in the
second that they saw the light, but did not hear the voice of
him that spoke (Acts ix. 7, and xxii. 9). At Damascus a man
named Ananias, directed also by a vision, went to Saul to
restore his sight, which had been destroyed for the moment by
the brilliancy of the celestial light. After this, Saul, subsequently
called Paul, escaping from the pursuit of the Jews who
had designs upon his life, began to preach in the name of
Jesus (Acts ix. 1-31).</p>

<p>Another convert of some consideration, from his official position
and from the fact that he was a heathen, was added to the
community about this time. This was Cornelius, the Centurion
of the Italian band. Cornelius was a religious man, much given
to prayer. Tired perhaps of visions, of which there had been
two in the last chapter and was to be another in this, Luke
introduces his angel—a sort of supernumerary ever ready to
appear when wanted—to effect the conversion of Cornelius.
The angel told him to apply to Peter, now at Joppa, for further
advice as to what he should do. Meanwhile Peter had on his
part been prepared by a vision of unclean beasts, which he was
desired to eat, for the reception of the Gentile embassy, and the
admission of Gentiles to the flock. He accordingly proceeded
to Cæsarea, where Cornelius was, and baptized both him and
other heathens, upon whom, to the great astonishment of the
Jews, the Holy Ghost was poured out and the gift of tongues
conferred. Thus did the Church of Christ begin, timidly and
feeling her way with caution, to extend her boundaries beyond
the limits of the Hebrew people (Acts x).</p>

<p>Some scandal was created in the congregation at Jerusalem
by Peter's violation of Jewish rules in dining with uncircumcised
people, but there was no gainsaying a vision like that
which he produced in reply. Shortly after these events the
apostle James, one of those two brothers whose mother had
petitioned that they might sit on two thrones, one on each side
of Jesus, when his kingdom came, was executed by Herod, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611"> 611</span>
tetrarch; who also imprisoned Peter, but was unable to keep
him on account of the angelic intervention mentioned above.
The death of this monarch from a painful internal disease, is
curiously perverted by the writer into a sudden judgment of
God, inflicted upon him because he accepted divine honors at
the hands of his flatterers (Acts xi. xii).</p>

<p>The history now proceeds to follow the fortunes of Paul. It
is stated that there were at Antioch certain prophets and teachers,
who were inspired by the Holy Ghost to appoint Barnabas
and Saul to the work whereunto they were called. Having laid
their hands upon them, they sent them away. Paul now began
to travel from place to place, making converts among the
heathen. At Paphos he met with a Jewish sorcerer named
Elymas, who he caused to be blind for a season, thereby inducing
the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus to believe in Christianity,
which had thus shown itself able to produce more powerful
sorcerers than the rival creed (Acts xiii. 1-12).</p>

<p>It is a striking proof of the liberality of the Jews at this
period that when Paul and his companions had gone into the
synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia, the rulers of the synagogue
invited them to speak; a freedom which even in the present
day would scarcely be granted in any Christian Church to those
who were regarded as heretics. Paul took advantage of the
proffered opportunity to deliver a speech which ended in the
conversion of some of the Jews. On the following Sabbath
great crowds came to hear Paul, but the Jews, as was natural,
opposed him and contradicted him. After this they stirred up
pious women and the principal men of the city against Paul
and Barnabas, and (it is stated) expelled them from their
coasts (Acts xiii. 50). These apostles having already determined
to go (Acts xiii. 46), it was not a severe treatment that was thus
inflicted on them. They, however, left Antioch in no very
charitable frame of mind, for they shook off the dust of their
feet against its inhabitants (Acts xiii. 14-52).</p>

<p>The cure of an impotent man at Lystra led the multitude of
that place to adore Paul and Barnabas as gods. Paul, as the
orator, they called Hermes, and Barnabas, Zeus. The priest of
Zeus brought oxen and garlands, and intended to sacrifice to
them, an intention which the people were barely prevented, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612"> 612</span>
the indignant protests of the two apostles, from carrying into
effect (Acts xiv. 8-18). This was not the only occasion on which
Paul was taken for a god; for when he was cast by shipwreck on
the island of Melita, his escape from injury by a venomous reptile
which had fastened on his hand was regarded by the savages
of that island as a proof of divinity (Acts xxviii. 1-6).</p>

<p>Extremely similar to these incidents, especially to the first,
is a circumstance recounted by Sir Francis Drake in his voyage
of circumnavigation. His vessel having sprung a leak, while
he was exploring the coast of North America, was brought to
anchor to be repaired, and the sailors landed to build tents and
make a fort for purposes of defense. The natives approached
them in companies, armed, and as if designing an attack, but
it appeared that they had "no hostile meaning or intent;" for
when they came near, they stood "as men ravished in their
minds, with the sight of such things as they never had seen
or heard of before that time: their errand being rather with
submission and feare to worship us as gods, than to have any
warre with us as with mortall men. Which thing, as it did partly
show itself at that instant, so did it more and more manifest itself
afterwards, during the whole time of our abode amongst them."
The General gave them materials for clothing, "withall signifying
unto them we were no gods, but men, and had neede of
such things to cover our own shame; teaching them to use
them for the same ends, for which cause wee did eate and
drinke in their presence, giving them to understand that without
that wee could not live, and therefore were but men as well
as they" ("we also are men of like passions with you") (Acts
xiv. 15). "Notwithstanding nothing could persuade them, nor
remove that opinion which they had conceived of us, that wee
should be gods" (W. E., p. 120).</p>

<p>And, as the heathens of Lystra were eager to sacrifice to
Barnabas and Paul, so those of this country actually conferred
this mark of divinity upon some of the white men in the company
of Drake, nor were the utmost protests of the travelers
of avail to put a stop to what appeared to them, just as it did
to the apostles, an impious rite, derogating from the honor due
to the true God. The people had come in a large body, accompanied
by their king, to make a formal presentation of the sov<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613"> 613</span>ereignty
to him, and the king had made over into his hands the
insignia of the royal office, when the scene now described by
Sir Francis took place.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The ceremonies of this resigning and receiving of the Kingdome
being thus performed," says Sir Francis, "the common sort, both of
men and women, leaving the king and his guard about him, with our
Generall, dispersed themselves among our people, taking a diligent view
or survey of every man; and finding such as pleased their fancies (which
commonly were the youngest of us), they presently enclosing them
about offred their sacrifices unto them crying out with lamentable
shreekes and moanes, weeping and scratching and tearing their very
flesh off their faces with their nails; neither were it the women alone
which did this, but even old men, roaring and crying out, were as violent
as the women were.</p>

<p>"We groaned in spirit to see the power of Sathan so farre prevaile
in seducing these, so harmlesse soules, and labored by all meanes, both
by shewing our great dislike, and when that served not, by violent withholding
of their hands from that madnesse, directing them (by our eyes
and hands lift up towards heaven) to the living God whom they ought
to serve; but so mad were they upon their Idolatry, that forcible withholding
them would not prevaile (for as soon as they could get liberty
to their hands againe, they would be as violent as they were before) till
such time, as they whom they worshiped were conveyed from them into
the tents, whom yet as men besides themselves, they would with fury
and outrage seeke to have again" (W. E., p. 129).</p>
</div>

<p>We are again reminded of the Acts: "And with these sayings
scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done
sacrifice unto them" (Acts xiv. 18).</p>

<p>An unfortunate change in the popular mind soon occurred;
for on the arrival of some Jews who stirred them up to hostility
against the Apostles, they flew from one extravagance to
another, and stoned Paul so severely that he was left by them
for dead. But as the disciples stood about him he rose, and
was able to continue his journey on the next day.</p>

<p>The Christians at Jerusalem were now required to consider
the difficult question of the circumcision of the Gentiles; their
decision upon which has already been discussed. After the
council Paul (who had returned to Antioch) proposed to revisit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614"> 614</span>
the places where he had formerly preached, and Barnabas intended
to go with him. But a difference of opinion as to
whether they should take Mark with them led to a violent
quarrel between these two apostles; as the result of which Paul
chose Silas as his companion, and left Barnabas to pursue his
own course with his friend Mark (Acts xv).</p>

<p>The writer now follows the fortunes of Paul in his missionary
work in various countries, and it is remarkable that in the sixteenth
chapter he drops the third person, and begins to speak
in the first person plural, implying that he himself was one of
the company. The fact that from this point onwards the book
becomes practically not the Acts of the Apostles, but the Acts
of Paul, who is evidently the hero of the story, indicates an
author who belonged to the Pauline section of the Church, and
to whom Paul was the chief living embodiment of the Christian
faith. Who this author was—whether Silas, or some other
companion—it would be hard to say, but he seems to have
written under the direct inspiration of Paul himself.</p>

<p>Increased by the addition of Timotheus, the party, guided
by a vision seen by Paul of a Macedonian entreating them to
come, went into Macedonia. At Philippi they met with some
success among women, making particular friends with a purple-seller
named Lydia. But the conversion of a divining girl who
was a source of profit to her employers, led to the imprisonment
of Paul and Silas, from which, however, an opportune
earthquake set them free (Acts xvi).</p>

<p>At Athens Paul made a speech on the Areopagos, in which
he ingeniously availed himself of an altar he had noticed, inscribed
"To an Unknown God," to maintain that this unknown
God was no other than the Jehovah of the Jews (Acts xvii. 16-34).
At Corinth he was allowed to preach every Sabbath in the
synagogue (as he had done at Thessalonica, and did again at
Ephesus), another evidence of the tolerant spirit of the Jews as
compared with Christians. Not, of course, that the Jews were
not bigoted adherents of their narrow creed, or that they had
any scruple about supporting it by physical force; but they
were willing to allow those who had a reformation to propose
to be heard in the synagogues. The effect, as might be expected,
was to embitter those who remained orthodox against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615"> 615</span>
Paul. But an attempt on their part to bring him under the
jurisdiction of the civil tribunals failed, and after remaining a
long time at Corinth, he went on to Ephesus, and thence continued
his course through Galatia and Phrygia (Acts xviii. 1-23).
An eloquent and able Alexandrian, Apollos by name, came to
Ephesus, after Paul had left it. He was a believer in John the
Baptist, and was received into the Church by Paul's friends,
Aquila and Priscilla, whom he had left behind.</p>

<p>A singular incident occurred on a subsequent visit of Paul's
to Ephesus. He found some disciples there and asked them
whether they had received the Holy Ghost. They replied that
they did not even know whether there was a Holy Ghost.
Such crass ignorance must have astonished Paul, who inquired
into what they had been baptized. They said, into John's baptism,
and the apostle accordingly baptized them in the name
of Jesus, with the striking result that they immediately received
the Holy Ghost and began to speak in tongues (Acts xix. 1-7).
Curious incidental evidence is thus supplied by the case of
Apollos and by that of these Ephesians of the existence of a
Johannine sect which Christianity superseded and swept into
oblivion; and it is remarkable, as affording a presumption that
the Baptist did not regard himself as the mere precursor of
Christ, that these Johannists do not appear to have been looking
forward to any further development of their principles such
as the religion of Jesus supplied.</p>

<p>At Ephesus Paul preached for three months in the synagogue,
and then, meeting with much opposition, betook himself to a
public room, where he disputed daily. But after he had taught
two years, a dangerous riot was excited by the tradesmen who
dealt in silver shrines for the Ephesian Artemis, and Paul,
after the disturbance had been quelled, determined to go into
Macedonia (Acts xix. 8-xx. 1). While he was preaching at
Troas, a young man, who had fallen asleep, fell from the window
at which he was sitting, and was supposed to have been
killed. Paul, however, declared that he was still alive, and told
them not to be disturbed. This opinion proved to be correct.
To this simple incident the historian, by stating that he was
"taken up dead," has contrived to give the aspect of a miracle.
The case exactly resembles the supposed miracle of Jesus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616"> 616</span>
discussed above (Supra, vol. i. p. 320-323), and is another illustration
of the facility with which natural occurrences may, by
the turn of a phrase, be converted into marvels (Acts xx. 7-12).</p>

<p>No arguments were now availing to dissuade the apostle
from visiting Jerusalem, where it was well known that peril
awaited him. Arrived at the centre of Judaism, his first business
was to clear himself from the suspicions entertained of his
rationalistic tendencies by taking a vow according to the
Mosaic ritual. After this the Asiatic Jews raised a clamor
against him which ended in a dangerous tumult. From the violent
death which threatened him at the hands of the enraged
multitude he was rescued by the Roman troops, under cover of
whose protection he made his defense before the people (Acts
xxi. 27-xxii. 21). It naturally did not conciliate the Jews; and
the Roman officer who had made him prisoner, having been
deterred from the application of torture by Paul's Roman citizenship,
desired his accusers to appear in court to prefer their
charges on the following day (Acts xxii. 22-30). But when the
case came on, Paul ingeniously contrived to set the Pharisees
against the Sadducees by the assertion that he himself was a
Pharisee, and that he was charged with believing in a future
state. By this not very candid shift he obtained the support of
the Pharisaic party, and produced among his prosecutors a
scene of clamor and discord from which it was thought expedient
to remove him. Defeated in the courts of law, the more
embittered of his enemies formed a scheme of private assassination
which was revealed to the captain of the guard by Paul's
nephew, and from which he was rescued by being sent by
night under a strong military escort to the governor of the
province, a man named Felix (Acts xxiii). Ananias, the high
priest, and others of the prosecutors, followed Paul to Cæsarea
in five days, but the nature of their charges was such that they
made little impression upon the mind of the governor. He
nevertheless kept Paul in confinement, perhaps hoping (as the
narrator suggests) that he would receive a bribe to set him free
(Acts xxiv). After two years Festus succeeded Felix, and when
this governor visited Jerusalem he was entreated by the priests
to send for Paul, which, however, he refused to do, and required
the prosecutors to come to him at Cæsarea. They went, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617"> 617</span>
charged Paul with offenses which it is said they could not
prove. When Festus asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem
to be tried by him, Paul replied that he ought to be
tried at Cæsar's judgment-seat, as he had done the Jews no
wrong, and that he appealed to Cæsar. The policy of this
appeal was questionable, for after a time Festus was visited by
King Agrippa, to whom he related the facts of the case; and
the king, having heard the statement of the prisoner himself,
declared that he might have been set at liberty had he not appealed
to Cæsar (Acts xxv., xxvi).</p>

<p>Paul therefore was now sent with a gang of prisoners to
Rome, on the way to which the ship he was in was wrecked off
the island of Melita, where the winter months were accordingly
passed. Here he cured numerous inhabitants of diseases, and
received high honors in consequence. After three months an
Alexandrine vessel conveyed the shipwrecked company to the
capital. Arrived at Rome, Paul summoned the Jews to come to
the house where, guarded by a soldier, he was allowed to live,
and endeavored to convert them. Meeting with indifferent success,
he dismissed them with insulting words drawn from Isaiah,
and roundly informed them that the salvation of God was now
sent to the Gentiles, and that these would hear it (Acts xxvii.,
xxviii). What was the ultimate fate of this great teacher of
Christianity, whether his case was ever heard, and if so, how it
was decided; whether he lived a prisoner, or was set free, or
died a martyr, we have no historical information, and it is useless,
in the absence of evidence, to attempt to conjecture.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 2.</span>—<i>The Epistles.</i></h5>

<p>In the epistles which have been preserved to us, and which
are no doubt but a few rescued from a much larger correspondence,
the apostolic authors enforce upon their respective converts
or congregations the doctrines of Christianity as understood
by them. They explain the relation of Jesus to the Jewish
law; they inculcate morality; they reply to objections; they
hold out the prospect of the speedy revolution which they expect.
Since their opinions on all the topics upon which they
touch cannot, within the limits of a general treatise, be dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618"> 618</span>cussed
in detail, all that is necessary now is to glance rapidly
at the more general characteristics of the several writers.</p>

<p>A letter addressed to the twelve tribes scattered abroad, and
traditionally ascribed to the apostle James, may best be taken
in connection with an anonymous epistle addressed to the Hebrews.
They have these two features in common, that they are
written to Jewish Christians, and that they discuss the relation
of faith to works. It is true that this question is treated by
their authors from opposite points of view. Theological controversy
began early in the history of the Christian Church, and
its first controversial treatises have been embodied in the Canon
of its Sacred Books. It appears, moreover, to be highly probable,
not only that the two epistles were written on opposite
sides of a disputed question, but that the chapter in the one
dealing with that question was designed as an answer to the
corresponding chapter in the other. It may be difficult to say
which was the original statement, which the reply; but when
we find the very same examples chosen by both, the one maintaining
that Abraham and Rahab were justified by faith,
the other that they were justified by works, it is not easy
to believe that so exact a coincidence in the mode of treating
their subject was accidental. The more argumentative
tone taken by James—as of one answering an opponent—induces
me to believe that his epistle was the later of the two.
The author of the Hebrews insists upon the paramount necessity
of faith; showing by a number of historical examples that
the conduct of the great heroes of the Hebrew race, besides that
of many inferior models of excellence, was wholly due to this
cause. The author of James, on the contrary, strenuously
maintains that faith is of no value without works, and, as if
endeavoring to set aside the force of the examples produced on
the other side, selects for his consideration the history of two
persons who had been held up as illustrations of the doctrine
that we are justified by faith. Abraham, he says, was not justified
by faith only, but by works; for he offered Isaac on the
altar, which was a very practical illustration of his faith (James
ii. 21-23). Rahab again, who according to you was saved from
destruction with the unbelievers by faith, was in reality justified
by works, for it was a work to receive the messengers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619"> 619</span>
send them out another way (James ii. 25). Not that we deny
the importance of faith altogether; but we do deny the exclusive
position which you, in your Epistle to the Hebrews, assign
to it. Without works faith is a dead, unproductive thing; like
a body without its animating spirit. Indeed a man may say to
him who relies upon his faith alone, Show me your faith without
works, and I will show you mine by my works. What is
the use of a faith unaccompanied by works? can it save any
one by itself? Certainly not, answers James; Certainly, says
the author of the Hebrews. The whole question turns on those
hair-splitting distinctions in which theologians have ever delighted;
for while the one party considers faith as the producing
cause of good actions, the other treats good actions as
the evidence of faith. Neither the one nor the other really
meant to question the necessity of either element in the combination.</p>

<p>In other respects there is a broad difference between the two
epistles. That to the Hebrews is Judaic in tone and spirit; its
main object being to prove that Christ is a sort of high-priest,
endowed with authority to set aside the old Jewish institutions
and substitute something better. James is more catholic and
more practical. He insists upon the necessity of not only hearing,
but doing the word; of keeping the whole moral law; of
bridling the tongue, and of showing no respect to persons on
account of their worldly position. He is extremely hostile to
the rich, and draws a very unfavorable picture of their conduct
(James ii. 6, 7, and v. 1-6). He encourages the poor Christians
to endure patiently till Christ comes, which will be very soon
(James v. 7, 8). Lastly, he emphatically urges the duty of proselytism
upon his flock; remarking that one who converts another
when wandering from the truth, both saves the soul of
the wanderer and hides a multitude of his own sins (James v.
19, 20).</p>

<p>Two epistles are attributed to the apostle Peter, the first of
which, addressed to the strangers in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia, and Bithynia, purports to be written from Babylon.
He holds out to his correspondents the hope of salvation which
they have through Jesus, which is a source of joy, notwithstanding
their present troubles. Among other precepts he counsels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620"> 620</span>
husbands and wives as to their mutual behavior; exhorting
wives to be obedient, and not to care too much for dress; and
requiring husbands to honor their wives as the weaker vessels
(1 Pet. iii. 1-7). The Second Epistle of Peter would appear to
be by a rather later author, for he has read the epistles of
Paul. He is troubled about "false teachers," who introduce
"heresies of destruction," and denounces them in no measured
terms (2 Pet. ii). Having, as above described, comforted the
Christians for the long delay in the second coming of the Savior,
he exhorts them not to be led away by the error of the wicked,
but to grow in grace and in the knowledge of their Lord (2 Pet.
iii. 17, 18).</p>

<p>Of the three epistles bearing the name of John, the first
only is of any considerable length. The style of this epistle is
extremely simple, and it reads like the kindly talk of an old
man to children. He tells his flock not to sin, not to love the
world, and to love one another. So much does he keep to these
purely general maxims, that it would be difficult to gather any
really useful instruction from his benevolent garrulity. It is
characteristic of him to insist again and again upon love as the
cardinal virtue of a Christian. Besides this, perhaps the most
definite advice he gives is to pray for anything desired, and to
entreat of God the forgiveness of a brother who has committed
a sin not unto death (1 John v. 14-16). With great self-complacency
he calmly asserts that he and his friends are of God, and
that the whole world lies in wickedness (1 John v. 19); a pleasant
mode of putting those towards whom it was impossible to
practice the love about which he spoke outside of the pale of
brotherhood.</p>

<p>The writer of John's second epistle, addressed to a lady and
her children, illustrates the kind of charity resulting from such
views as this, when he tells them not to receive into their
house, nor bid "farewell" to any one who does not hold correct
doctrines (2 John 10). The third epistle, written to Gaius,
contains little beyond matters of purely personal interest. The
Epistle of Jude, who calls himself brother of James, denounces
certain "ungodly men," who have "crept in unawares," and
are doing great mischief in the Church. It is principally interesting
from its reference to the legend of the contest of Michael<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621"> 621</span>
the archangel with the devil for the body of Moses, which popular
tale the writer seems to accept as unquestionably authentic
(Jude 9).</p>

<p>Having thus referred to the writings which bear, whether
correctly or not, the names of the original apostles of Jesus, we
come to those of one who was far greater than any of these—the
apostle who was not converted until after the death of his
Master. Paul, to whom the great majority of the epistles preserved
in the New Testament are ascribed, and by whom many
of them were undoubtedly written, is the central figure of the
apostolic age, and the one who redeems it from the somewhat
unintellectual character it would otherwise have had. Through
him it principally was that Christianity passed from the condition
of a Jewish sect to that of a comprehensive religion.
What Christ himself had been unable to do, he did. What the
apostles of Christ shrunk from attempting, he accomplished.
He himself was not unconscious of the magnitude of his labors.
Hence there is noticeable now and then in his writings, though
veiled under respectful phrases, a sort of intellectual contempt
for the older apostles, who were not always prepared for the
thorough-going measures which appeared to him so obviously
expedient. He is extremely anxious not to be thought one whit
inferior to them by reason of his comparatively late appointment
to the apostleship. He carefully rebuts the suspicion that
he acted in subordination to them, or even in conjunction with
them, after his conversion. His course, he is anxious to let
every one know, was taken in entire independence of the
Church at Jerusalem. Moreover, he insists emphatically upon
his personal qualifications. Was any one a Hebrew? so was he.
Had others received visions or revelations? so had he. Had
others been persecuted? so had he. He is fond of dwelling
upon his individual history in order to support his claims.
Thus he tells us that in former times he persecuted the Church
of God, and that he was more Jewish than the Jews, being
even more zealous than they of the traditions of his fathers. It
was therefore entirely by special revelation from God, and not
by any human agency whatever, that he was consecrated to his
present work. Indeed his revelations were so abundant that it
needed a "thorn in the flesh" to prevent him from being too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622"> 622</span>
proud of them—a work, however, in which the thorn was not
entirely successful. His sufferings for the sake of the gospel
afforded him another and more legitimate cause of satisfaction.
He says of these that he received thirty-nine stripes from
the Jews on five occasions; that he was thrice beaten with
rods; once stoned; thrice shipwrecked; a day and night in the
deep (in an open boat?); often in all sorts of perils, in watchings,
cold and thirst, hunger and nakedness. Once too he
escaped from arrest at Damascus, which does not seem a very
serious calamity (2 Cor. xi. 22-28.—Gal. i. 11-24).</p>

<p>Now the object of all these autobiographical statements is
evidently to place himself on a level with other apostles who
might seem at first to be more highly privileged than he was.
Not so, he contends; if they are ministers of Christ, I am quite
as much so; if they saw Christ before his death, I have seen
him after it; if they have labored in his cause, I have labored
more; if they have suffered for his sake, I have suffered more.
Hence my authority is in every respect equal to theirs, and
should there be a difference of opinion between us you must
believe me, your pastor, rather than them. Nay, even if an
angel from heaven should preach any other gospel than that
which I have preached, you must not believe him; much more
then must you disbelieve an apostle. Besides, appearances are
deceptive, and as Satan may appear in the character of an angel
of light, so the ministers of Satan may, and do appear in the
character of apostles of Christ (2 Cor. xi. 13-15.—Gal. i. 8). There
was therefore a section of the Church—probably the Judaic
section, under the guidance of one of the original apostles—with
whom Paul was at issue, and whom he considered it
incumbent upon him to oppose by every argument in his
power. These are they whom he refers to as "troubling" the
Galatians, and perverting the Gospel of Christ (Gal. i. 7).</p>

<p>Such was the view taken by Paul of his function in the rising
sect. Whatever may have been its logical justification, it
was fully justified by facts. In power of reasoning, in grasp of
principles, in comprehensiveness of view, he was not only "not
a whit behind the chiefest apostles," but far before them. His
letters are by far the most remarkable of the writings which
the New Testament contains. They evince a mind almost over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623"> 623</span>burdened
by the mass of feelings struggling for expression.
He is profoundly penetrated with the new truth he has discovered,
or rather which Christ has discovered to him, and he
seems to have scarcely time to consider how he may best
express it. His mind, though wealthy in ideas and fertile in
applying them to practice, is not always clear. It seems rather
to struggle with its thoughts than to command them. Hence a
certain confusedness in style, a crowding together of notions in
a single sentence, and a want of logical arrangement in his presentation
of a subject, which render his epistles not altogether
easy reading. It may have been those characteristics which
caused another apostle (or one who wrote in that apostle's
name) to say that there were some things in the writings of his
beloved brother Paul that were "hard to be understood" (2 Pet.
iii. 16).</p>

<p>When, however, the uncouth style is surmounted, the thought
will be found well worthy of consideration. Of all the writers
in the New Testament Paul is the one who presents the largest
materials for intellectual reflection. Whether or not we agree
in his views, we can scarcely refuse to consider his arguments.
And herein he is peculiar among his associates. He is the only
one of the canonical writers who has any notion of presenting
arguments for consideration at all. While others dogmatize,
he reasons. He may reason badly, but he has at least the
merit of being able to enter in some degree into the views of
his opponents, and of attempting to reply to them on rational
grounds.</p>

<p>Another striking feature of the mind of Paul is its robustness.
Brought up a Pharisee, a sect devoted to extending the
regulations of the law to the utmost minutiæ, he nevertheless
rose completely above the domination of trifles. Even matters
which in most religions are regarded as of capital importance,
he treated as of little moment in themselves. Ceremonies,
observances, outward forms of every kind he held in slight
esteem in comparison with moral conduct. Not the mere
knowledge of the Jewish law or the power of teaching it to
others, is of any avail, but the observance of its ethical precepts
(Rom. ii. 17-23). Uncircumcision is just as good as circumcision,
provided the uncircumcised man keep the law. The true Jew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624"> 624</span>
is not he who is a Jew outwardly, nor true circumcision that
performed upon the flesh. He is the true Jew who is one
inwardly, and that is true circumcision which is in the heart
(Rom. ii. 24-29). Indeed, in the renovated condition which is
effected by Christianity, there is neither Greek nor Jew; neither
circumcision nor uncircumcision; neither barbarian, Scythian,
slave, nor freeman; but Christ is everything and in everything
(Col. iii. 11.—Gal. iii. 28). In the same rationalistic spirit he lays
down the admirable rule that external forms are valuable only
to those who think them so. One man believes he may eat
everything; another eats only herbs. One man esteems all days
alike; another esteems one day above another. The freethinker
must not despise the one who holds himself bound by such
things, nor must this latter condemn the freethinker. The
really important matter is that every one should have a complete
conviction of his own. In that case, whatever conduct he
pursues in these trivialities, being dictated by his conscience, is
religious conduct. On the one side, the more scrupulous must
not pass judgment on the less scrupulous, that being the office
of Christ; but, on the other side, the less scrupulous must
endeavor not to give offense to the more scrupulous. In illustration
of this doctrine Paul confesses that to him personally the
Jewish distinction between clean and unclean meat is totally
unmeaning; yet if his brother were grieved by his eating the
so-called unclean meats, he would rather give up the practice
than destroy by his meat ones for whom Christ had died. All
things, indeed, are pure in themselves, yet it is not well to eat
flesh or drink wine if another is scandalized thereby. We who
are strong-minded, and have surmounted these childish scruples
of our forefathers, must bear the infirmities of the weak rather
than please ourselves (Rom. xiv., xv. 1).</p>

<p>Certainly when the things are in themselves totally indifferent,
the principle of concession to the superstitions of minds
governed by traditional beliefs may sometimes be advantageously
adopted. But the importance of protesting against the
bondage exercised by such beliefs over human life is also not
to be underrated, and Paul seems scarcely to give it sufficient
weight in the preceding argument. No doubt on the ground of
policy, and in reference to the desirability of keeping the mem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625"> 625</span>bers
of the nascent sect from internal quarrels, Paul was right;
but a principle which in certain cases may be expedient for a
given end, is not to be set up as a universal rule of ethics. Nor
is it obvious that Paul intended to do this. He himself, if
questioned, would probably have admitted that there were
limits beyond which concession ought not to go, those limits
being fixed by the consideration that such concession, if pushed
too far, must end in the perpetual subordination of the whole
of the Christian body to the weaknesses of its least enlightened
members. The morality expressed in the lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Leave thou thy sister when she prays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her early heaven, her happy views,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor thou with shadowed hint confuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A life that leads melodious days,"</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pnind">is good morality under certain conditions, but there is too great
a tendency on the part of those who retain their "early
heaven" to press this conduct upon those whose "faith has
centre everywhere, nor cares to fix itself to form." It ought
not to be forgotten that but for the Christian disregard of
forms, persevered in in despite of the scandal to the Jews,
Christianity must always have remained a branch of Judaism.</p>

<p>A peculiar merit to be set to Paul's account is, that he is the
only one of all the writers in the New Testament who treats
the supremely important question of the relations of the sexes,
a subject so remarkably overlooked by Christ himself. Whether
the guidance he affords his converts on this head is good guidance
or not, he does at least attempt to guide them. Let us
notice first what he considers abnormal relations, and then proceed
to what he lays down as a normal one. In the first Epistle
to the Corinthians he is loud in his denunciations of a man
who cohabited with his father's wife, the father being, I presume,
deceased. Whether the son had married his stepmother,
or merely lived with her, is not altogether clear, since, in either
case, the apostle might brand their connection with the title of
fornication. However, he condemns it utterly and without reference
to any accompanying circumstances, desiring the Corinthian
community to deliver up the man to Satan for the de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626"> 626</span>struction
of the flesh, in the name and with the power of their
Lord Jesus, in order that his spirit might be saved at the day
of judgment (1 Cor. v). Here then we have an early example of
excommunication, accompanied by the formula to be used in
performing the solemnity.</p>

<p>That the severe reproof bestowed by Paul upon the Corinthians
for permitting such conduct greatly affected them, we
gather from the tenderer language employed in the subsequent
epistle, where he admits having at one moment repented that
he had caused them so much sorrow, though he soon saw that
it had been for their good (2 Cor. vii. 8-13). It is gratifying,
also, to find that his tone towards the unfortunate individual who
had been excommunicated at his desire is greatly softened, and
that he desires the Corinthians to forgive him, and receive him
back into their body, lest he should be swallowed up with too
much sorrow (2 Cor. ii. 6, 7). It would have been interesting
had he informed us why he considered cohabitation with a stepmother
so terrible a crime, but such a recurrence to first principles
was not to be expected. He, no doubt, acted on a purely
instinctive sentiment of repugnance to such an arrangement.</p>

<p>A second kind of relation between the sexes which the apostle
condemns is that of prostitution. Here he has not left us
equally in the dark as to the grounds upon which his condemnation
is founded. Not only does he prohibit prostitution to
the Christians, but he tells them exactly why they ought not to
indulge in it; and his argument upon this subject is sufficiently
curious to merit a moment's examination. In the first place,
then, he tells his disciples that neither fornicators, nor adulterers,
nor Sodomites, nor practicers of various other vices not of a
sexual nature, will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. vi. 9, 10;
Eph. v. 5). Fornication should not even be named among the
Christians (Eph. v. 3). They must mortify their members upon
earth, for impure connections and sexual license bring down the
wrath of God (Col. iii. 5, 6). They must exclude from their society
any one who is guilty of such irregularities (1 Cor. v. 9-11).
"The body is not for prostitution, but for the Lord, and the
Lord for the body." The bodies of Christians are the members
of Christ: "Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make
them the members of a prostitute? God forbid. What! do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627"> 627</span>
not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? for
the two [he says] shall be one flesh" (1 Cor. vi. 13-16). It was
surely a very original notion of Paul's to extend to the casual
connections formed by the temporary passion the solemn sanction
bestowed upon the permanent union of man and wife. It
is said in Genesis that a man and his wife are to be one flesh,
and this is obviously an emphatic mode of expressing the closeness
and binding character of the alliance into which they enter.
But what may appropriately be said of married persons cannot
of necessity be said of persons linked together only by the most
fleeting and mercenary kind of ties. The very evil of prostitution
is, that the prostitute and her companion are <i>not</i> one flesh
in the allegorical sense in which husband and wife are so; and
to condemn it on account of the presence of the very circumstance
which is conspicuously absent, is to cut the ground from
under our feet. But let us hear the apostle further. "But he
that is joined to the Lord is one spirit. Flee prostitution.
Every sin that a man commits is outside of the body [what
can this mean?], but the fornicator sins against his own body.
What! do you not know that your body is the temple of the
Holy Spirit in you? which you have of God, and you are not
your own" (1 Cor. vi. 17-19). Now in this singular argument it
is noticeable that the ground taken up is entirely theological.
Destroy the theological foundation, and the ethical superstructure
is involved in its ruin. Thus, if we do not believe that our
bodies are the members of Christ, nor the temples of the Holy
Spirit, Paul has no moral reason to give us against the most
unlimited indulgence in prostitution. While, even if we admit
his premises, it is not very easy to see how his conclusion follows.
For why should we not make the members of Christ
those of a prostitute, unless it be previously shown that it
would in any case be wrong to do so with our own members?
It would not (according to Paul himself) be wrong to make the
members of Christ members of a wife; why, then, should it be
wrong to make them members of any other woman whatever?
Clearly this question could not be answered without an attempt
to prove, on independent grounds, the evil of promiscuous indulgence
of the sexual passion. But no such attempt is made by
Paul. He has therefore failed completely to make out a case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628"> 628</span>
against even the most unbridled license. Not that his conclusion
need therefore be rejected. On the contrary, the danger of
his arguments is not that his view of morals is fundamentally
erroneous, but that he rests an important precept upon a dangerously
narrow basis.</p>

<p>Pass we now to that which he considers as the normal relation
between the sexes. The subject may be divided into three
heads: that of the formation of such relations, that of their
character when formed, and that of their disruption. Upon all
of these the apostle has advice to give.</p>

<p>In the first place it appears that the Corinthians had applied
to him for a solution of some question that had been raised
among them as to the propriety of entering at all into the matrimonial
state. In answer to their inquiries he begins by
informing them that it is good for a man not to touch a
woman. He would prefer it if every one were like himself
unmarried. To unmarried people and widows he says that they
had better remain as they are. Concerning virgins of either sex
he delivers his private opinion that their condition is a good
one for the present necessity. A married man indeed should
not endeavor to get rid of his wife; but neither should an
unmarried man endeavor to obtain a wife. The time is so short
till the final judgment of the world that it makes little difference;
before long both married and unmarried will be in the
same position. Meantime, however, celibacy is the preferable
state; and that because celibates care for the things of the
Lord, how they may please the Lord; but married people care
for one another, and study to please one another (1 Cor. vii. 1-34).
Why Paul should suppose that married people, even while
studying one another's happiness, might not also endeavor to
please the Lord, it is hard to understand. He seems in this passage
to lend his sanction to the very dangerous doctrine that a
due discharge of the ordinary duties of life is incompatible with
attention to the service of God. As if the highest type of
Christian life was not precisely that in which both were combined
in such a manner that neither should be sacrificed to the
other. But, apart from this fundamental objection to his theory
it is liable to the remark that the assumptions on which it
rests are untrue. Unmarried persons, unless the whole litera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_629"> 629</span>ture
of fiction, dramatic and novelistic, utterly belies them, care
at least as much to become married as married persons care to
promote one another's comfort. Indeed, it would be no less
true to nature to say, that the unmarried in general take more
pains to please some persons of the opposite sex than husbands
take to please their wives, or wives their husbands. Not to
dwell upon the fact that courtship involves a greater effort,
mental and physical, than the mere continuance of love assured
of being returned, there is the obvious consideration that the
mere outward circumstances of the unmarried are far less
favorable than those of the married to the enjoyment of their
mutual society without considerable sacrifice of time. Hence
the estimate made by Paul of the relative advantages of the
two states is untrue to facts, except in the rare cases of those
who have firmly resolved upon a life of celibacy, and who, in
addition to this, have so perfect a control over their passions,
or so little passion at all, as to be untroubled by sexual imaginations.</p>

<p>That these objections are well founded might be proved by
reference to a picture (drawn either by Paul himself or by some
one who assumed his name) of the conduct of young widows.
Having to consider the question what widows may properly be
supported by the charity of the Church, this writer refuses to
admit any of them to the number of pensioners until they are
sixty years old, apparently on the ground that they cannot be
trusted to give up flirting altogether before they have reached
that age. Young widows are to be rejected, for when they have
begun to wax wanton against Christ, they wish to marry; a
damnable tendency, but one which it is so hopeless to get rid
of, that the best thing they can do is to marry, to have children,
and manage their households. Otherwise they will gad about
gossiping and tale-bearing from house to house; not only idle,
but mischievous (1 Tim. v. 9-15). So that the ideal conception of
unmarried persons caring only to please the Lord had at least
no application to Christian widows.</p>

<p>While recommending celibacy, Paul is careful not to encourage
breach of promise of marriage. If a man thinks he is
behaving unhandsomely towards his betrothed, who is passing
the flower of her age, he may marry her: he is not doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630"> 630</span>
wrong. Nevertheless, if he feel no necessity for a sexual relation,
and resolve to keep her a virgin, he does well. So then
marriage is good, but celibacy is better (1 Cor. vii. 36-38).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these views, Paul, or at least the Pauline
Christian who wrote the first Epistle to Timothy, by no means
contemplates a celibate clergy. It is specially enumerated
among the qualifications of a bishop that he is to be a good
manager of his household, keeping his children well in order;
for (it is argued) if a man cannot rule his own house, how will
he be able to take care of the Church of God? The only limitation
placed upon the bishops is that they are not to be polygamists.
They, as well as the deacons, are to keep to a single
wife (1 Tim. iii. 1-5).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his general preference for celibacy, Paul
recognizes certain reasons as sufficing to excuse the establishment
of a sexual relation, and it is important to note what, in
the apostle's judgment, these reasons are. Now it is remarkable
that he seems to perceive no consideration whatever in
favor of the matrimonial condition but its ability to satisfy the
sexual appetite. To avoid fornication a man is to have his own
wife; if people cannot restrain themselves, they should marry,
for it is better to marry than to burn. Those who marry are
not guilty of sin, although they will have trouble in the flesh
(1 Cor. vii. 2, 9, 28). Such a view of the functions of matrimony
as this is simply degrading. It treats it as exactly equivalent
to prostitution in the uses it fulfills, and as differing only in the
durability of the connection. But if the whole object of the
connection is merely to gratify passion, its greater durability is
but a questionable advantage. For exactly as marriage is
recommended "to avoid fornication," so divorce might often be
recommended to avoid adultery. A union of which the main
purpose is to give a convenient outlet to desire, had better be
broken when it ceases to fulfill that office to the satisfaction of
both the parties. It is strange that Paul should seem to have
no conception whatever of the intellectual or moral advantages
to be derived from the sympathetic companionship of one of
the opposite sex. Perhaps his age presented him with scarcely
any examples of marriages in which that companionship was
carried into the higher fields of human thought or action. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631"> 631</span>
he might still have acknowledged something more in the emotion
of love than a special condition of the human body. Christianity
has done much to raise the character of marriage, but
not one of its achievements in that respect can be credited to
the writings of its chief apostle.</p>

<p>Such being the grounds on which the matrimonial bond was
to be contracted, it was natural that when contracted, the relation
of the parties to each other should not be one of a
very exalted order. Paul has, in fact, little of moment to
recommend under the second head (that of the character of
these relations) except the subjection of women, and on this he is
certainly emphatic enough. Wives are to submit themselves to
their own husbands: husbands are to love their wives (Col. iii.
18, 19.—Eph. v. 22, 25). An extraordinary reason is given in one
epistle (possibly indeed not written by Paul) for requiring
women to learn with subjection, and forbidding them to teach,
or usurp authority over men. It is that Adam was formed first,
and Eve after him, and that Adam was not deceived, but Eve
was (1 Tim. ii. 11-14). Scarcely less absurd than this is the
argument (and again I must note that it occurs in an epistle of
doubtful authenticity) that the husband is the head of the wife,
as Christ is of the Church, and that just as the Church is subject
to Christ, so must wives be subject to their husbands. And
as Christ loved the Church, so are husbands to love their wives,
considering them as equivalent to their own bodies, which they
cannot hate (Eph. v. 22-33)—although it did not appear that
when man became "one body" with a prostitute he was therefore
to love her. These views of the duty of submission on the
part of wives are not indeed surprising in that early age, for
they have continued to the present day. The writer of these
epistles is only chargeable with not being in advance of his
fellow-men. It required all the genius of Plato, whom not even
the greatest apostle could approach, to foreshadow for women
a position of equality which they are but now beginning to
attain.</p>

<p>Besides these rules there is another laid down by Paul for
the conduct of married parties which evinces his strong common
sense. Husbands and wives are mutually to render one
another their "due." They have not absolute power over their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632"> 632</span>
own bodies. They must not therefore defraud one another of
conjugal rights, unless for a short time with a view to fasting
and prayer, and then only with mutual consent (1 Cor. vii. 3-5).
Paul therefore would have given no sanction to that very questionable
form of asceticism in which husbands deserted their
wives, or wives their husbands, to pursue their own salvation,
regardless of the happiness of their unfortunate consorts. All
such persons he would have bidden to return to the more indisputable
duties of the marriage-bed.</p>

<p>Such a doctrine, however, to make it properly applicable to
practice, would require to be supplemented by a doctrine of
divorce; otherwise there is no provision for the case of an
invincible repugnance arising in one of the parties towards the
other, or in both towards each other. And this brings me to
the third head of the apostle's teaching; his views on the disruption
of the marriage-tie. Here he has little to say except
that the wife is not to quit her husband, or that, if she do, she
must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband; and
that the husband is not to put away his wife. In cases where
one is a Christian and the other not, they are not absolutely
under bondage: they may separate, though it does not appear
that they may marry again. But the apostle strongly advises
them to keep together, in the hope that the believing member
of the couple may save the other (1 Cor. vii. 10-16). It is plain
from this summary that the apostle, no more than his Master,
faces the real difficulties of the question of divorce. For the
case of unhappy unions, except in the single instance of the
one party being a Christian, he has no provision whatever. It
is remarkable, however, that he several times intimates in the
course of this chapter that he is not speaking with the authority
of Christ, but simply expressing his personal opinions; a
proviso which looks as if he himself were unwilling to invest
these views with full force of the sanction they would otherwise
have derived from his apostolical commission.</p>

<p>There is another subject on which the opinions expressed by
Paul are open to considerable comment—the resurrection of the
dead. In a chapter which for its beauty and its eloquence is
unparalleled in the New Testament, he discusses the Christian
prospect of another life. Had he confined himself to rhetoric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633"> 633</span>
I should have been contented simply to admire, but he has
unfortunately mingled argument with poetic vision in a very
unsatisfactory manner. In the first place, he attempts to deduce
the resurrection of the dead from the resurrection of Christ.
If, he contends, there be no resurrection of the dead, then
Christ is not risen; our preaching is vain, and so also is your
faith (1 Cor. xv. 12-20). He fails to perceive that the resurrection
of Christ—a man whose whole life, according to him, was
full of prodigies—could be no guarantee for the resurrection of
any other individual whatever. Christ had already been
restored to life in a manner in which no other person had ever
been restored. His body had been reanimated after two days,
before it had had time to suffer decomposition, and that without
the intervention of any other person, competent like Christ
himself, to perform a miracle. How then could so unprecedented
an occurrence warrant the expectation of the reanimation of
those who had been long dead, and whose bodies had suffered
decomposition? Plainly there is here a palpable <i>non sequitur</i>.
Christ might be raised without this fact involving a general
resurrection; and a general resurrection might happen without
Christ having been raised. Further on he makes a still more
amazing blunder. Answering a supposed antagonist, who puts
the natural question, "With what body are the dead raised?"
he exclaims, "Fool! that which thou sowest is not quickened
except it die;" (1 Cor. xv. 36.) implying that he conceived the
change undergone by seed dropped into the ground to resemble
the death of the human body. Now it is needless to point out
that the organic processes constituting physical life do not
cease in the grain which (as he says) grows up into wheat or
some other corn; and that if they did cease, that "body that
shall be," which he compares to the bodies of men in their expected
resurrection, never would appear at all. The grain, in
short, would not grow. An adversary, had he been on the alert,
might have retorted upon Paul (borrowing his own courteous
phraseology): "Idiot! that which thou sowest is not quickened
<i>if</i> it die." Such a retort would have been completely crushing.
Another very fatal mistake of Paul's is the contention that if
the dead do not rise, we have no reason to do anything but
enjoy the passing hour. "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634"> 634</span>
we die" (1 Cor. xv. 32). Nothing can be more dangerous than
such language as this; for if a man bases his moral system
upon the belief in a future life, the destruction of that belief
will involve the destruction of his moral system. It is founding
the more certain upon the less so; universal conceptions upon
special ones; that which is essential to human existence upon
the doctrines of a particular creed held only by a portion of the
human race. The argument is a favorite one with theologians,
because it enlists in favor of the doctrine of a future state all
the strong attachment by which we cling to principles of morals.
None the less is it illegitimate, and it ought to be sternly
rejected.</p>

<p>Next in beauty to this eloquent description of the future
state of man may be reckoned the extremely fine chapter on
brotherly love in the same epistle. Brotherly love, according
to Paul, never fails, though intellectual gifts, such as prophecies,
tongues, and knowledge, will pass away. Hope, faith, and
brotherly love are joined together by him as a trinity of virtues
which "now abide;" but the greatest of these is brotherly
love (1 Cor. xiii).</p>

<p>Scattered about in the writings of this apostle there are also
some admirable maxims of conduct, extremely similar in tone
to those of Jesus. Thus, he tells his fellow-Christians to be
kindly affectioned one to another; to bless those that persecute
them—to bless and not to curse; to return no man evil
for evil; give food to a hungry enemy and drink to a thirsty
one; and generally, not to be overcome by evil, but to overcome
evil by good (Rom. xii. 10-21.—1 Thess. v. 15). It were
much to be wished that he himself had remembered these beneficent
rules of conduct in the case of Alexander the coppersmith,
who he says did him "much evil," and concerning whom he
utters the significant prayer that the Lord may reward him
according to his works (2 Tim. iv. 14).</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 3.</span>—<i>The Apocalypse.</i></h5>

<p>The author of the Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation, who
professes to have seen the vision he describes at Patmos, gives
himself the name of John; a circumstance which led in former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635"> 635</span>
times to the belief that the work was the composition of John
the disciple of Jesus. It is a rather late production, having
been written subsequently to the establishment by Paul of
Gentile Christian communities in various parts of Asia. It also
presupposes the existence of a sect of heretics termed Nicolaitanes,
who had arisen in some places, and was therefore probably
not written until some time after the foundation of these
churches by the great apostle.</p>

<p>The author endeavors to add lustre to his work by proclaiming
at its outset that it was committed to writing under the
direct inspiration of Jesus Christ himself, who dictated it to
him, or rather showed it to him, when he was "in the Spirit
on the Lord's day." Notwithstanding this exalted authorship, it
is a production of very inferior merits indeed. It is conceived
in that style of overloaded allegory of which the art consists in
concealing the thought of the writer under images decipherable
only by an initiated few. The Book of Daniel is an example of
the same kind of thing. A false interest is excited by this
style from the mere difficulty of comprehending the meaning.
How widely it differs from that mode of allegory which possesses
a real literary justification, may be shown by comparing the
Apocalypse with the "Pilgrim's Progress." In Bunyan, the
thought is revealed under clear and transparent images; in
John, it is concealed under obscure and turbid ones. Hence
there have been endless interpretations of the Apocalypse;
there has been only one of the "Pilgrim's Progress." That
characteristic which Holy Writ has been shown to possess of
calling forth a multitude of comments and speculations upon
its meaning belongs in a preëminent degree to the Revelation
of John.</p>

<p>After writing by the instructions of Christ a letter to each of
the Seven Churches, the author proceeds to describe his vision.
There was a throne in heaven, upon which God himself was
seated. He had the singular appearance of a jasper and a sardine
stone. Beasts, elders, angels, saints, and a promiscuous
company besides were around the throne, engaged in performing
the ceremonies of the celestial court. Various works were
executed according to orders by the attendant angels. A beast
then arises out of the sea, and is worshiped by those whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636"> 636</span>
names are not in Christ's book. "Babylon the Great," under
the form of a harlot, is judged and put an end to. An angel
comes down from heaven and binds "that old serpent, which is
the Devil and Satan," for a thousand years. During this millennium
Christ reigns on earth, and all who have been martyrs
for his sake, or have not worshiped the beast, rise from the
dead to reign with him. After the thousand years are over
Satan is unfortunately released from prison, and does a great
deal of mischief, but is ultimately recaptured again and cast
into a lake of fire and brimstone. A second resurrection, for
the unprivileged multitude, now takes place. All the dead stand
before God, and are judged by reference to the records which
have been carefully kept in heaven in books provided for the
purpose. All who are not in the book of life are thrown into
the lake of fire, to which death and hell are consigned also.
The inspired seer is now shown a new heaven, a new earth, and
a new Jerusalem which comes down from heaven. For a
moment he rises from the extremely commonplace level upon
which he usually moves to an eloquent picture of that happier
world in which "God shall wipe away all tears from" the eyes
of men; when "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain." The book
concludes with a curse upon any one who shall in any manner
tamper with it, either by way of addition or erasure, and with
a promise from Jesus that he will come quickly.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Subdivision 4.</span>—<i>The God of Christendom.</i></h5>

<p>Although the God whom Jesus thought himself commissioned
to represent, and in whom his disciples believed, is the historical
continuation of the Jehovah of Hebrew Scripture, yet his
character is in many important aspects widely different. No
longer the arbitrary and irascible personage who continually
interfered with the current of human affairs, rewarding here,
punishing there; now overthrowing a monarch, now destroying
a nation; he exercises a calmer and more equitable sway over
the destinies of the world. As the servile occupants of the
bench in former days too often combined the functions of prosecutors
with those of judges, so Jehovah in the ancient times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637"> 637</span>
of Israel had sometimes thrown off the judicial dignity to act
with all the <i>animus</i> of a party to the cause. This was natural
perhaps where the subject-matter of the inquiry was the worship
and honor to be paid to himself. It was natural that he should
take a strong personal interest in such cases; but as all opposition
(among the Jews at least) had passed away, and he remained
in exclusive possession of the throne, he could afford to
treat the charges with which he had now to deal—mere infractions
of morality, for example—in a much more impartial
spirit.</p>

<p>In addition to this cause of transformation, the natural
growth of religious feeling had tended to replace the older deity
by a modified conception, and Jesus, falling in in this respect
with the course of thought already in progress, contributed to
effect a still further modification in the same direction. Hence,
although there is nowhere an absolute break between the old
and the new conceptions, the God of the New Testament is
practically a very different person from the God of the Old.
We cannot conceive him doing the same things. The worst
action, in the way of interference in mundane matters, of which
the God of the New Testament is guilty, is, perhaps, the sudden
slaughter of Ananias and Sapphira. But what is this to such
enormities as the deluge, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,
or the commission of bears to devour little children who
had ridiculed the baldness of a prophet? Horrors like these,
so consistent with the general mode of procedure of the ancient
Jehovah, are wholly incompatible with the characteristics so
often ascribed to the more recent God. According to the theories
of the New Testament, the crime committed by the Jews
in executing Jesus was at least as great as the crimes for which
the antediluvians and the Sodomites had been so ruthlessly
exterminated. Yet we cannot imagine Jesus as even wishing
for the extermination of his contemporaries by water or by fire.
The God whose love for mankind he had been teaching could
not for a moment be thought of as consenting to such a course.
While Elijah the Tishbite is represented as positively praying
for the instant death of one hundred men who came to him
with a message from his king, Jesus, on the contrary, is depicted
as actually healing the only one of his enemies who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638"> 638</span>
been in any way injured in effecting his arrest. Plainly when
the conduct of the prophets is thus dissimilar, the deity whom
they represent on earth is dissimilar also.</p>

<p>Another very marked alteration to be observed in passing
from the character of Jehovah to that of God, is the emancipation
of the object of worship from the limits of race. Jehovah
was altogether a Jew. He kept the Sabbath-day; he loved
fasts and festivals; he believed strongly in the virtue of circumcision;
he was interested not so much in the general well-being
of the human species, as in the success of the single people of
whom he was the true leader in battle and the ultimate sovereign
at home. What happened to all the remainder of mankind
was to him a matter of trivial moment, although it might suit
him occasionally to use them as instruments either for the
chastisement or the restoration to favor of his beloved Israel.
But God in the New Testament has largely cast off the special
features of his race, and although he sometimes betrays his
Judaic origin, he is in the main cosmopolite in his sympathies
and impartial in his behavior. Though by no means catholic
in religion, but holding exclusively to a single faith, he receives
all who embrace that faith, of whatever nation, within the
range of his favor. This great and deeply important change,
though begun by Jesus, was in the main the work of Paul. If
it was Jesus who constructed the tabernacle, it was Paul who
built the temple.</p>

<p>While, however, there is an enormous improvement if we
compare the administration of human affairs by Jehovah and
by God, there is nevertheless a blot upon the character of God
which suffices, if rigorously balanced against the failings of
Jehovah, to outweigh them all. It is the eternity of the punishment
which he inflicts in a future life. No amount of sophistry
can ever justify the creation of beings whose lives are to terminate
in endless suffering. But while the <i>reality</i> of condemnation
to such endless suffering would be a far more gigantic crime
than any of the merely terrestrial penalties inflicted by the
Hebrew Jehovah, the <i>belief</i> in such endless suffering is quite
consistent with a much higher general conception of the divinity
than the one that coëxisted with the belief in those terrestrial
penalties. The explanation of this apparent paradox is to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639"> 639</span>
found in the fact that the necessary injustice of eternal punishment
is not very easily perceived; that, in fact, it is not understood
at all in the ruder stages of social evolution, and not by
every individual even in so advanced a society as our own.
Some degree of punishment for offenses is felt to be requisite;
and it is not observed without considerable reflection that that
punishment in order to be just must needs be finite; must needs,
if imposed by absolute power, aim at the ultimate reformation
of the criminal, not at his ultimate misery. And it takes a far
higher degree of mental cultivation to feel this than it takes to
feel the injustice of the violent outbursts attributed in the Old
Testament to Jehovah. Tradition and custom alone could have
prevented Jesus and his disciples from feeling shocked at these;
while it was intellectual capacity which was needed to enable
them to reject eternal punishment as incompatible with justice.
Add to these considerations the very important fact that the
conduct conducing to salvation, and avoiding condemnation in
the future state, was supposed to be known to all men beforehand,
being fixed by unalterable rules; while the conduct necessary
to ensure the terrestrial rewards, and escape the terrestrial
penalties of the Old Testament, was not known till the
occasion arose; sometimes not till after it had arisen. Thus,
Jesus lays down in his teaching both the rules to be observed
by human beings if they would obtain the approbation of his
Father, and the exact manner in which the violation of those
rules will be visited upon them if they fail to repent and
obtain forgiveness. But Jehovah only made his rules from
time to time, and never announced beforehand what his punishments
would be. Who, for instance, could tell what he would
do to the Israelites for worshiping the golden calf? who could
say whether he would treat gathering sticks on the Sabbath, as
to which there was as yet no law, as a capital crime? still
more, who could imagine that he would visit the action of a
monarch in taking a census of Israel by a pestilence inflicted
on the unoffending people? Plainly it was a very rude notion
of deity indeed which was satisfied to suppose an arbitrary interposition
in all such cases. The God of the New Testament
may be more cruel, but he is also more consistent. If I may
venture on a homely comparison, I should say that the Jehovah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640"> 640</span>
of the Israelites is like a capricious Oriental despot, whose subjects'
lives are in his hand, while the God of Christendom rather
resembles a judge administering a Draconian code in which
there should be no gradations between capital punishment
and entire acquittal. The laws may in fact demand more
bloodshed than the tyrant; but their existence and administration
by fixed rules would undoubtedly imply that a people had
reached a higher grade of civilization. Moreover, exactly as
government conducted by laws is capable of improvement by
modification of the legislative enactments, while despotic government
is essentially vicious, so the character of God admits of
easy adaptation to the needs of a more cultivated state, while
that of Jehovah can by no possibility be rendered consistent
with a high ideal of divinity.</p>

<p>Such adaptation of the Christian God has actually taken place
to a very large extent. The doctrine of Purgatory, leaving only the
most incorrigible offenders to be consigned to hell, was already
a considerable step in advance of the teaching of the New Testament.
It got rid of the fundamental weakness in the conception
of Jesus, wherein there was no proportion of punishment
to offense; every sin, small or great, was either absolutely forgiven
or punished to the uttermost extent. It effected the same
beneficent change as Romilly effected in the English law.
Precisely as our former code punished even trifling crimes with
death or not at all, so the God of Jesus punished sin either eternally
or not at all. Precisely as the excessive severity of English
law led to the entire acquittal of many criminals who
should have received some degree of punishment, so the excessive
severity of God led to the belief and hope that many
sinners would be entirely pardoned who should in justice have
received some measure of correction. Thus, in both these cases,
the undue harshness of the threatened penalty tended to defeat
the very object in view.</p>

<p>But the character of the God of Christendom admits of a
much more thorough reformation than that effected by the
Catholic Church. Tender spirits, offended, like Uncle Toby, at
the notion that even the worst of beings should be damned to
all eternity, have simply refused to accept the notion of endless
torture. Thinkers, aiming at a system of abstract justice, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641"> 641</span>
sought to prove that it could not be. Theologians have contrived
all sorts of shifts to dispense with the necessity of believing
it. Modern feeling, whether on grounds of logic or of sentiment,
has gradually come to suppress it more and more as an
inconvenient article in the nominal creed, to be, if not consciously
rejected, at least instinctively thrust as much as possible
out of sight. There has resulted an idea of the Deity in
which the harsher elements are swept away, and the gentler
ones, such as his fatherhood, his care, and his love, are left
behind. Such writers as Theodore Parker, Francis W. Newman,
and Frances Power Cobb, have carried this ideal to the highest
point of perfection of which it appears to be capable. Their
God is still the God of Christendom, but refined, purified and
exalted. The work which the Jewish prophets began, which
Jesus carried on, at which all the nations of Christendom have
labored, they have most worthily completed. Whether the ideal
thus attained is destined to be final, whether it really represents
the ultimate possibilities of religious thought that can remain
as the corner-stone of a universal faith, are questions that can
be answered only when we have undertaken the complete analysis
of those most general constituents of all theological systems
which the foregoing examination has disclosed. On that
last analysis we are about to enter.</p>

<small>THE ULTIMATE ELEMENTS.</small></h3></div>


<p>We have now examined and classified the various phenomena
manifested by the religious sentiment throughout the world.
We have found these phenomena to have been in all ages of
history, and to be now among all races of men, fundamentally
alike. Diverse as the several creeds existing on the face of the
earth appear to a superficial observer, yet the rites, the practices,
the dogmas they contain, admit of being ranged under
certain definite categories and deduced from certain invariable
assumptions. The two leading ideas of consecration and of
sanctity pervade them all, and while the mode of consecration,
the objects consecrated, the things, places, men, or books
regarded as sacred, differ in every quarter of the globe, the
feelings of the religious man remain the same.</p>

<p>Let us take a rapid survey, before proceeding further, of the
ground we have already traversed. Wherever any religion exists
at all, we have found consecrated <i>actions</i>: that is, actions
devoted to the service of God. Such actions, it is assumed,
have some kind of validity or force, either in bringing from the
deities addressed by the worshipers some species of temporal
blessing, or in ensuring happiness in a future state, or in im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644"> 644</span>proving
his moral character in this. Secondly, we no sooner
rise above the very rudest forms of religion, than we find <i>places</i>
set apart for worship, and entirely abstracted from all profaner
uses. Thirdly, we find that it is a universal practice to dedicate
certain <i>objects</i> to the special use of the divine beings
received in the country; such objects being various in their
nature, but very frequently consisting of gifts to the accredited
ministers of the God for whom they are intended. Fourthly,
we find in all the greater religions—the Confucians possibly
excepted—a number of <i>persons</i> who have devoted themselves
to a mode of life supposed to be especially pleasing to God, and
carrying with it in their minds the notion of superior sanctity.
Lastly, we have in almost every form of faith a special <i>class</i>,
generally of male persons only, who are set apart, by some distinctive
rite, to the performance of the consecrated actions
required by the community to be done on their behalf; these
actions thus acquiring a double consecration, derived primarily
from their own nature, and secondarily from the character of
those by whom they are performed.</p>

<p>Passing to the second of our main divisions, we found the
conception of sanctity applied generally where that of consecration
had been applied, the distinction being that while the
latter was imparted by man, the former was the gift of God.
Thus, in the first place, just as human beings consecrate some
of their actions to the service of God, so he, in his turn, sanctifies
certain <i>events</i> to the enlightenment of mankind. It is the
same in the second case, that of <i>places</i>; for here the deity
sometimes points out a holy spot by some special mark of his
presence, sometimes (and more commonly) condescends to sanctify
those which man has devoted to his worship. And, thirdly,
as men set apart some of their property for him, so he imparts
to some of the <i>objects</i> in their possession a holy character,
which endows them with peculiar powers, either over external
nature, or over the mind and conscience of those who see,
touch, or otherwise use them. Fourthly, he endows the <i>class</i>
who perform the ceremonies of religion with his peculiar grace;
a grace commonly evinced in their power to consecrate places,
things, and men, to forgive sins, to convey the apostolic succession,
to administer sacraments, and so forth; but occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645"> 645</span>
manifested in the shape of supernatural endowments. And
fifthly, as there are many of both sexes who give themselves to
him, so there have been a few <i>men</i> to whom he may be said to
have given himself, having invested them with authority to
teach infallible truth, and found religions called after their
names. Sixthly, he has revealed himself in a way to which
there is nothing corresponding on the human side, by means of
<i>books</i> composed by authors whom he inspired with the words he
desired them to write.</p>

<p>Viewed in the gross, as we have viewed them now, these
several manifestations of religious feeling cancel one another.
That feeling has indeed expressed itself in the same general
manner, but with differences in detail which render all its
expressions equally unimportant in the eyes of science. For, to
take the simplest instance, nothing can be said by a Christian,
on behalf of the inspiration of his Scriptures, which might not
be said by the Buddhist, the Confucian, or the Mussulman on
behalf of the inspiration of theirs. If his appear to him more
beautiful, more perfect, more sublime, so do theirs to them;
and even if we concede his claims, the difference is one of
degree, and not of kind. So it is in reference to miracles.
Christianity can point to no miracles tending to establish its
truth, which may not be matched by others tending to establish
the truth of rival creeds. And if we find believers of every
kind in every clime, attaching the most profound importance to
the exact performance of religious rites in certain exact ways,
while, nevertheless, those ways differ from age to age and from
place to place, we cannot but conclude that every form of
worship is equally good and equally indifferent; and that the
faith of the Christian who drinks the blood of Christ on the
banks of the Thames, stands on the same intellectual level
with that of the Brahman who quaffs the juice of the Soma on
the banks of the Ganges.</p>

<p>But this line of argument seems to tend to nothing short of
the absolute annihilation of religion. Under the touch of a
comparative anatomy of creeds, all that was imposing and magnificent
in the edifice of theology crumbles into dust. Systems
of thought piled up with elaborate care, philosophies evolved
by centuries of toilsome preparation, fall into shapeless ruins at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646"> 646</span>
our feet. And all this by the simple process of putting them
side by side.</p>

<p>Can we, however, rest content in the assumption that so vast
a superstructure as that of religion has no solid foundation in
the mind of man? And is it destined, like the theologies it has
evolved in the course of its existence to disappear entirely
from a world enlightened by scientific knowledge?</p>

<p>Two questions must be carefully distinguished from one
another in replying to the doubt thus suggested. The first is
whether religion, although it may contain no objective truth, or
no objective truth ascertainable by us, nevertheless possesses,
from some circumstance in its own nature, or in the nature of
the world we live in, a hold upon the human race, of which it
cannot by any advance of knowledge be deprived. Is there, in
short, if not an everlasting truth, yet an everlasting dream from
which there is to be no awakening, and in which spectral
shapes do duty for external realities? An affirmative reply
would admit the existence of religious sentiment to be a necessary
result of the constitution of the human mind, but would
not concede the inference that conclusions reached by means of
that sentiment had any objective validity, or any intellectual
worth beyond that which they derive from the imagination of
those who believe them. The second question is whether there
are in the fundamental composition of religious sentiment any
elements not only necessary, but true; and if so, what those
elements are, and what is the proof of their credibility, if proof
there be.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to answering either of these questions, it is
needful to ascertain whether in the midst of the variety we
have passed in review, there is any fundamental unity; in other
words, whether the varied <i>forms</i> of religion are all we can ever
know of it, or whether underlying those forms there is a permanent
<i>structure</i> upon which they are superposed. For only
when we know whether there is in all the creeds of the world
a common element, can we proceed to inquire whether there is
an element which is a necessary result of the constitution of
our minds. If the phenomena evinced by the several religions
to which we have referred in the previous book have no common
source in human nature; if, while they differ in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647"> 647</span>
article of their theology, there is nothing beyond theology in
which they agree; then religion is a mere superficial product of
circumstances, having no more solid guarantee than the authority
of the particular teachers of each special variety. There is
in fact no religion; there are only religions. There is no universal
Faith; there is only particular Belief.</p>

<p>These, then, are the queries to which our attention must be
addressed:—</p>

<p>1. Are there in the several religions of mankind any common
elements?</p>

<p>2. If so, are those common elements a necessary, and therefore
permanent, portion of our mental furniture?</p>

<p>3. If so, are those elements the correlatives of any actual
truths, or not?</p>

<p>It may have been observed that all the phenomena we have
examined in the previous Book imply one assumption, and cannot
be understood without that assumption. All of them imply
some kind of power or powers either behind, beyond, or external
to the material world and the human beings who inhabit
it, or at least involved in and manifested through that world
and its inhabitants; some power whose nature is not clear to
us, but whose effects are perceptible to our senses; some power
to which we ourselves and the material world are equally subject.
Sometimes indeed the power which religion thus assumes
is broken up into several minor forces, and instead of a single
deity we have several deities controlling the operations of
nature. But, without dwelling now upon the fact that polytheistic
creeds often look above the lesser beings whom they commonly
put forward to a more mysterious and greater God, it
may be observed that these minor forces are no more than
forms of the one great force from which they are parted off by
an imaginative subdivision. To place the ocean under one
divinity, the winds under another, and the sun under a third,
is practically a mental process of the same kind as to place
them all under a single divinity; and the existence of some
such cause of material phenomena being granted, it is a mere
question of less or greater representative capacity whether we
range them under numerous chiefs or comprehend them all
under one. In either case we assume extra-mundane and super<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648"> 648</span>human
power, and this is the essential assumption of all religion.
The least assumption a religion can make is that of a
single such power, and this (or more than this) it always must
assume. For without this we should remain within the boundaries
of science; we should examine and classify phenomena,
but we could never pass beyond the phenomena themselves to
their mysterious origin or their hidden cause.</p>

<p>But this is not the only assumption involved in every possible
religion. Every religion assumes also that there is in human
nature something equally hyperphysical with the power which
it worships, whether we call this something soul, or mind, or
spirit. And between this human essence and the divine power
there is held to be a singular correspondence, their relationship
finding its concrete expression in religious worship on the one
side and theological dogma on the other. All the practices and
all the doctrines of every positive religion are but the modes in
which men have sought to give body to their idea of this relationship.</p>

<p>We have then, strictly speaking, three fundamental postulates
involved in the religious idea:—</p>

<p>First, that of a hyperphysical power in the universe.</p>

<p>Secondly, that of a hyperphysical entity in man.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that of a relation between the two.</p>

<p>The power assumed in the first postulate we may term the
objective element in religion; the entity assumed in the second
postulate we may term the subjective element. In the following
chapter we shall deal with the objective element in the religious
idea.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<small>THE OBJECTIVE ELEMENT.</small></h3></div>


<p>The general result which has thus been reached by the
decomposition of religion into its ultimate constituents must
now be rendered somewhat more specific by illustrative examples
tending to explain the character of the power the idea of
whose existence forms the foundation of the religious sentiment,
and such examples will tend to throw light upon the question
whether the admission of such a power is or is not a necessity
of thought. For the proof of necessity is twofold; <i>a posteriori</i>
and <i>a priori</i>. We may show by the first mode that certain
assumptions are always made under certain conditions as a
matter of fact; not that they are always made by every human
being, but that given the appropriate grade of culture, the
beliefs in question arise. And we may show by the second that
no effort of ours is able to separate certain ideas which have
become associated in our minds; that the association persists
under every strain we can put upon it, and that the resulting
belief is therefore a necessary part of the constitution of the
mind. Both modes of proof must be attempted here.</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, it must be remarked that few, if any,
of the nations of the world are wholly destitute of some religious
creed; and that those which have been supposed, rightly
or wrongly, to be without it, have generally been savage tribes
of the lowest grade of culture. So slender is the evidence of
the presence of a people without some theological conception
that it may be doubted whether the travelers who have
reported such facts have not been misled, either by inability to
comprehend the language, or unfamiliarity with the order of
thought, of those with whom they conversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_650"> 650</span></p>

<p>Sometimes the absence of religion seems to be predicated of a
people which does not present an example of the kind of belief
which the European observer has been accustomed to consider
as religious. An instance of this is afforded in Angas' account of
"Savage Life in Australia." Of the Australians he states that
"they appear to have no religious observances whatever. They
acknowledge no Supreme Being, worship no idols, and believe
only in the existence of a spirit whom they consider as the
author of ill, and regard with superstitious dread." So that in
the very act of denying a religion to these people he practically
ascribes one to them. They, like Christians, appear to acknowledge
a powerful spirit; and if they dwell upon the evil side of
his works more than upon the good side, it is to be remembered
that Christians too consider their deity "as the author of
ill" by his action in cursing Adam with all his posterity; and
that they too regard him "with superstitious dread" as a being
who will send them to eternal torture if they fail to worship,
to think, and to act as he enjoins them. Immediately after
this, the author informs us that the Australians constantly carry
firesticks at night, to repel malignant spirits, and that they
place great faith in sorcerers who profess to "counteract the
influence of the spirits" (S. L. A., vol. i. p. 88). So that their destitution
of "religious observances" is in like manner merely
comparative.</p>

<p>Very little, if any, belief in deity appears to exist in Kamtschatka.
Steller, who has described the creed of its inhabitants,
states that they believe in no providence, and hold that they
have nothing to do with God, nor he with them (Kamtschatka,
p. 269). Whether this amounts to a denial of his existence I
cannot say. They have, however, another element of religion,
belief in a future state, as will afterwards appear.</p>

<p>In primitive religions the abstract form of Deity is often
filled up with the concrete figures of departed relatives. Indeed
this is one of the modes in which that form acquires definiteness,
becoming comprehensible to the savage mind from this
limitation of its generality. Thus in Fiji, although a supreme
God and various other gods exist, the ancestors appear to be
the most popular objects of worship. Deceased relations of the
Fijians (according to Seemann) take their place at once among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651"> 651</span>
the family gods (Viti, p. 389-391). Another author confirms this
testimony. In Sandwich Island, in the Fijian group, he states
that there are no idols. "The people worship the spirits of
their ancestors" (N. Y., p. 394). In Savage Island again they
pay their forefathers similar homage, and remark that they
once had an image which they worshiped, but that they broke
it in pieces during an epidemic which they ascribed to its influence
(Ib., p. 470). Among the Kafirs the spirits of the dead
are believed to possess considerable power for good and evil;
"they are elevated in fact to the rank of deities, and (except
where the Great-Great is worshiped concurrently with them)
they are the only objects of a Kafir's adoration" (K. N., p. 161).</p>

<p>Similar evidence is given by Acosta in reference to Peru. In
that country there existed a highly-developed and elaborated
worship of the dead. The bodies of the Incas, or governors of
Peru, were kept and worshiped. Regular ministers were devoted
to their service. Living Incas had images of themselves
constructed, termed brothers, to which, both during the life-time
of their original and after his death, as much honor was
shown as to the Incas themselves. These images were carried
in procession designed to obtain rain, and fair weather, and in
time of war. They were also the objects of feasting and of sacrifices
(H. I., b. 5, ch. vi). But the adoration of the dead was
not of such exclusive importance in Peru as in some countries
of inferior culture, and the most prominent positions in their
system were occupied by the Sun and the soul of the world,
Pachacamac, who was in fact their highest God (C. R. b. 2, ch.
iii).</p>

<p>These last examples introduce us to the more general conception
of deity which, in all religions but the very lowest, is found
along with the belief in supernatural beings of an inferior class,
and in some of them overshadows and expels it. The Peruvians,
as just stated, assigned the first rank to him whom they
conceived to have created and to animate the universe. The
Fijians adored a supreme Being Degei or Tangaroa. Lastly,
the "Great-Great," mentioned in the above quotation from
Shooter, is a being who seems from the somewhat contradictory
evidence of travelers to have been regarded as God by some of
the Kafirs, but to have been wholly neglected by others. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652"> 652</span>
in a passage quoted from a work of Captain Gardiner's by
Canon Callaway, we find a conversation of the writer's with a
native, in which the latter denies all knowledge of deity whatever,
and expresses a vague notion that the things in the world
may "come of themselves." Of another tribe the same writer
asserts that "they acknowledged, indeed, a traditionary account
of a Supreme Being, whom they called Ookoolukoolu (literally
the Great-Great), but knew nothing further respecting him,
than that he originally issued from the reeds, created men and
cattle, and taught them the use of the assagai." Canon Callaway
is apparently of opinion that the word Unkulunkulu was
not in use among the natives of South Africa in the sense of
God until it was introduced by Captain Gardiner (R. S. A., vol.
i. pp. 54, 55). Considerable suspicion is thus thrown upon any
statements in which this name is employed for the Creator. If,
however, we may accept a statement of Shooter's, "the Kafirs
of Natal have preserved the tradition of a Being whom they
call the Great-Great and the First Appearer or Exister." According
to this writer "he is represented as having made all
things," but this tradition "is not universally known among
the people." A chief who was asked about Unkulunkulu, the
Great-Great, knew nothing about him, but one of his old men,
when a child, "had been told by women stooping with age that
there was a great being above." There is also "a tribe in Natal
which still worships the Great-Great, though its recollection of
him is very dim." This tribe calls upon Unkulunkulu in the
act of sacrifice and in sickness (K. N., pp. 159, 160). While this
testimony leaves it doubtful whether Unkulunkulu is worshiped
at all, except by this single tribe, the traditions collected by
Canon Callaway in the first volume of his valuable work point
to the presence of a well-marked legend of creation in which
that deity figures as the originator of human life. True, he is
also spoken of as the first man, and in this fact we have the
probable reconciliation of the view which treats him as the
Supreme Being, with that which denies that his name was used
with this signification. Unkulunkulu was the primæval ancestor
of mankind, but he was also the Creator. Ancestor-worship
finds its culmination in him. But he has been much neglected
in comparison with minor deities, and the word Unkulunkulu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653"> 653</span>
has been applied to the ancestor of special tribes instead of to
the ancestor of all mankind.</p>

<p>The general result seems to be that some, though not all of
the Zulus, have in their minds a more or less definite idea of a
First Cause of existence, but that this First Cause is not worshiped
and is but little spoken of. Thus, an old woman questioned
by an emissary of Canon Callaway's related this:—</p>

<p>"When we spoke of the origin of corn, asking, 'Whence
came this?' the old people said, 'It came from the Creator who
created all things. But we do not know him.' When we asked
continually, 'Where is the Creator? for our chiefs we see?' the
old men denied, saying, 'And those chiefs too whom we see,
they were created by the Creator.' And when we asked, 'Where
is he? for he is not visible at all. Where is he then?' we heard
our fathers pointing towards heaven and saying, 'The Creator
of all things is in heaven. And there is a nation of people
there too'" (R. S. A., vol. i. p. 52).</p>

<p>But while Unkulunkulu is generally considered as the Creator
by the Zulus, it would appear that a neighboring people,
called the Amakxosa, had heard of a "lord in heaven" even
greater than him, whom they called Utikxo. According to the
evidence of an old native the word Utikxo is not of foreign
origin. Utikxo was appealed to when a man sneezed, and "as
regards the use of Utikxo, we used to say it when it thundered,
and we thus knew that there is a power which is in heaven;
and at length we adopted the custom of saying, Utikxo is he
who is above all. But it was not said that he was in a certain
place in heaven; it was said he filled the whole heaven. No
distinction of place was made" (Ib., vol. i. p. 65). In the
opinion of this authority, Utikxo had been in a manner superseded
by Unkulunkulu, who, because he was visible while the
original power was invisible, was mistaken for the Creator and
for God (Ib., vol. i. p. 67).</p>

<p>Testimony of a similar nature is given in regard to other
regions of Africa. In Juda it is stated that the most intellectual
of the great men had a confused idea of the existence and
unity of a God (V. G., vol. ii. p. 160). Oldendorp states broadly
that "all negro peoples believe that there is a God, whom they
represent to themselves as very powerful and beneficent." He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654"> 654</span>
adds that among all the black nations he has known, there is
none that has not this belief in God and that does not regard him
as the author of the world. They call him by the same name
as heaven, and it is even doubtful whether they do not take
heaven for the supreme Being. "But perhaps," he adds, "they
do not even think so definitely" (G. d. M., p. 318). So that the
conception of the Highest God in the regions visited by this
missionary is still vague and indefinite, like that we have found
in Juda and in Natal.</p>

<p>If now we turn to another quarter of the globe we find the
peculiarly degraded and ignorant Greenlanders asserting that,
although they knew nothing of God before the arrival of the
missionaries, yet that those of them who had reflected on the
subject had perceived the necessity of creative power, and had
inferred that there must be a being far superior to the cleverest
man. They had, in fact, used the argument from design, and
thus prepared, they had gladly believed in the God preached
by the missionaries, for they found that it was he whom they
had in their hearts desired to know (H. G., p. 240). A similar
conviction of the existence of a supreme God prevailed in the
new world when it was discovered by Europeans. Such a God
was acknowledged in Mexico and Peru, as also in the less civilized
regions of the North. Speaking of the American Indians,
Charlevoix observes that nothing is more certain, yet nothing
more obscure, than the idea which these savages have of a
primæval Being. All agree in regarding him as the first Spirit,
the Ruler and the Creator of the world; but when further
pressed, they have nothing to offer but grotesque fancies, ill-considered
fables, and undigested systems. Nearly all the Algonquin
nations (he adds) call the first Spirit the Great Hare;
some term him Michabou, and others Atahocan. He was apparently
supposed by some to have been a kind of quadruped, and
to have created the earth from a grain of sand drawn from the
bottom of the ocean, and men from the dead bodies of animals
(N. F., vol. iii. p. 343).</p>

<p>The great religions of the world have all of them (Buddhism
alone excepted) acknowledged a God, whom they pictured to
their minds in various ways according to the degree of their
development and their powers of abstract thought. Dimly shad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655"> 655</span>owed
forth in the Confucian system under the title of Heaven,
plainly acknowledged, yet mystically described by the Hindoos
under many titles, whereof Brahma is one of the most usual,
celebrated in plainer language by the classical heathens as
Zeus or Jupiter, this great being appears in the three kindred
creeds of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, as Jehovah, as Allah,
and as God. In Buddhism, however, there is no article of faith
corresponding to the belief in God. The Buddha is himself the
most exalted being in the universe, and he is neither almighty
nor eternal. The creation of matter as also of man appears to
be unaccounted for. There is no single being who can be
regarded as the ruler of all things, and the highest object of
Buddhist worship. But it must not be supposed that Buddhism
has escaped the universal necessity of admitting spiritual
powers superior to human beings. In the first place it retained
the Indian deities, such as Brahma, Indra, and others, and
though, subordinating all of them to Buddha, yet left them in
possession of enormous capacities. In the second place, the
Buddha in fact, though not in name, assumed the rank of a
God. Practically, he is far more than human. He himself
determines the place, time, and manner of his incarnation. He
delivers infallible doctrine. He becomes an object of adoration,
receiving divine honors from his followers. And although the
reigning Buddha (having entered Nirvâna) is non-existent, and
cannot aid his disciples, the future Buddha, or Bodhisattva, can
do so, and he is addressed in prayer for the same purposes for
which a Christian would invoke the intercession of his Savior.
Thirdly, it is to be remarked that Buddhism, free from the single
idea of God, is not free from the multitudinous idea of
supernatural essences. Its theology, so to speak, is quite full
of celestial beings of various ranks and functions, who swarm
around the terrestrial believers and perform all kinds of wonders.
To these remarks it may be added that in Nepaul, one of
the countries where Buddhism prevails, the non-theistic form
has been superseded by a theistic form, in which there are
divine Buddhas corresponding to the human Buddhas; the highest
of these, Adi-Buddha, being equivalent to the highest God
of other creeds. And it is at least noteworthy, that in Ceylon,
where the non-theistic form prevails in all its purity, the peo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656"> 656</span>ple
have a habit of invoking demons to their aid, and of employing
the priests of these demons, in all the more important
emergencies of their domestic lives.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined, however, that I wish to undervalue
the importance of the exception which Buddhism presents to
the general rule. Far from it. It ought, in my opinion, to be
always borne in mind as a refutation of the statement that
belief in a personal God is a necessary element of all religion.
Europeans are apt to carry with them throughout the world
their clear-cut notions of deity as a powerful being who created
the world, put man into it, governs it in a certain manner, and
assigns punishments and rewards to the souls of men in a
future state. This belief appears to them so necessary and so
natural that they expect to find it universally prevailing, and
regard it as the indispensable foundation on which all religion
must be built. Buddhism, however, the creed which, after
Christianity, has probably exerted the greatest and most wide-spread
influence on human affairs, knows no such article of
faith; and our general ideas of the universal constituents of
religion must needs be modified to embrace this fact.</p>

<p>Some superhuman power must, however, be recognized in
every religion, and it is the manner in which this superhuman
power is described, the qualities ascribed to it, its unity or
plurality, its relation towards man, and similar distinctions,
which serve to differentiate one form of religion from another.
The degree of definiteness is one of the most important features
in this differentiation. Generally speaking, the definiteness of
this idea and the development of the religion vary inversely as
one another. This law, however, is obscured by the continual
tendency to put forward, to worship, and to speak about in
ordinary cases, some inferior deity or deities, while there is
lurking behind the vague idea of a higher entity who is seldom
mentioned, little or never worshiped, and who possibly has no
name in the language. So that the gods or idols who are worshiped
by the people must not be taken as embodying the best
expression of their religious thoughts. Some instances of the
occurrence of this phenomenon will serve as illustrations of the
foregoing statement.</p>

<p>On the coast of Guinea the people "have a faint idea of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657"> 657</span>
true God, and ascribe to him the attributes Almighty and
Omnipresent; they believe he created the universe, and therefore
vastly prefer him before their idol-gods; but yet they do
not pray to him, or offer any sacrifices to him; for which they
give the following reasons. God, they say, is too highly exalted
above us and too great to condescend so much as to trouble
himself, or think of mankind: wherefore he commits the government
of the world to their idols" (C. G., p. 348). The manner
in which Utikxo, the highest God, is thrown into the shade
by the more intelligible and human Unkulunkulu (as shown in
a previous extract) is another example of the operation of this
law. And it is especially noteworthy that the Amazulu have
also a "lord of heaven," with attributes corresponding to those
of Utikxo, for whom they have no name. Anonymity, or if not
absolute anonymity, the absence of any name commonly employed
in the popular language is, as we shall see, one of the
most usual features of this most exalted Being. Other travelers
give similar accounts of other regions of Africa. Winterbottom,
who was especially acquainted with Sierra Leone and its neighborhood,
says that "the Africans all acknowledge a supreme
Being, the creator of the universe; but they suppose him to be
endowed with too much benevolence to do harm to mankind,
and therefore think it unnecessary to offer him any homage"
(S. L., vol. i. p. 222). Of Dahomey we learn from Winwood
Reade (a writer not likely to be partial to theism, or to discover
it where it does not exist), that the natives erect temples to
snakes, but "have also the unknown, unseen God, whose name
they seldom dare to mention" (S. A., p. 49). In another country
in Africa the same writer found that the natives worshiped
numerous spirits, and believed also in an evil Genius and a
good Spirit. The former they were in the habit of propitiating
by religious service; but the latter "they do not deem it necessary
to pray to in a regular way, because he will not harm
them. The word by which they express this supreme Being
answers exactly to our word God. Like the Jehovah of the
Hebrews, like that word in masonry which is only known to
masters and never pronounced but in a whisper and in full
lodge, this word they seldom dare to speak; and they display
uneasiness if it is uttered before them." The writer states that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658"> 658</span>
he only heard it on two occasions; once when his men cried it
out in a dangerous storm, and once when having asked a slave
the name for God, the man "raised his eyes, and pointing to
heaven, said in a soft voice <i>Njambi</i>" (Ib., p. 250). Again, in a
lecture on the Ashantees, Mr. Reade informed his hearers that
"the Oji people," although believing in a supreme Being, do
not worship him: while they do worship "a number of inferior
gods or demons," to whom they believe the superior God,
offended with mankind, has left the management of terrestrial
affairs.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the peculiarity thus observed in the old
world is precisely repeated in the new. Of the Mexicans it is
stated that "they never offered sacrifices to" Tonacatecotle
who was "God, Lord, Creator, Governor of the Universe," and
whom "they painted alone with a crown, as lord of all." As
their explanation of this conduct "they said that he did not
regard them. All the others to whom they sacrificed were men
once on a time, or demons" (A. M., vol. vi. p. 107, plate 1).
Concerning the Peruvians, Acosta tells us that they give their
deity a name of great excellence, Pachacamac, or Pachayachacic
(creator of heaven and earth), and Usapu (admirable). He
remarks, however, with much surprise, that they had no proper
(or perhaps general) name in their language for God. There
was nothing in the language of Cuzco or Mexico answering to
"Deus," and the Spaniards used their own word "Dios."
Whence he concludes, somewhat hastily, that they had but a
slight and superficial knowledge of God (H. I., b. 5, ch. iii).</p>

<p>In reference to Peru, however, we have still more trustworthy
evidence from a member of the governing family, or Incas.
From his statements it appears that the name applied to the
Highest was pronounced only on rare occasions, and then with
extremest reverence. This name was Pachacamac, a word signifying
"he who animates the whole world," or the Universal
Soul, as it would be termed in Indian philosophy. Like other
creeds that of Peru had its secondary deity, the Sun, in whose
honor sacrifices were offered and festivals held, while no temples
were erected, and no sacrifices offered to Pachacamac,
although the Peruvians adored him in their hearts and looked
upon him as the unknown God (C. R., b. 2, ch. iii).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_659"> 659</span></p>

<p>Ancient religion presents similar facts. In his exhaustive work
on Sabaeism, Chwolsohn observes that the fundamental idea of
that form of faith was not, as is often supposed, astrolatry. To
Shahrastani (the Arabian scholar), and many others who followed
him, Sabaeism expressed the idea "that God is too sublime
and too great to occupy himself with the immediate management
of this world; that he has therefore transferred the
government thereof to the gods, and retained only the most
important affairs for himself; that further, man is too weak to
be able to apply immediately to the Highest; that he must
therefore address his prayers and sacrifices to the intermediate
divinities, to whom the management of the world has been intrusted
by the Highest." Further on, the author asks himself
whether this conception was peculiar to the Harranian Sabaeans,
and replies, "Certainly not. This fundamental idea is tolerably
old, and in later times found admission to some extent even
among the strictly monotheistic Jews.... In the heathen
world this view was universally shared by the cultivated classes,
at least in the first centuries of the Christian era" (Ssabismus,
vol. i. p. 725).</p>

<p>Indian theology teems with the conception of a sublime but
unknowable deity far superior to the deities of popular adoration,
who has no name and whose greatness cannot be adequately
expressed in human language. Indian philosophy loses
itself in a sea of mystic terms when it endeavors to speak of
this all-pervading and preëminent Being. Take, for example,
the following from the Chândogya Upanishad, one of the
treatises appended to the Sâma Veda. A father is instructing
his son:—</p>

<p>"'Dissolve this salt in water, and appear before me to-morrow
morning.' He did so. Unto him said (the father), 'My
child, find out the salt that you put in that water last night.'
The salt, having been dissolved, could not be made out. (Unto
Swetaketu said his father), 'Child, do you taste a little from the
top of that water.' (The child did so. After a while the father
inquired), 'How tastes it?' 'It is saltish' (said Swetaketu)."
The same result followed with water taken from the middle and
the bottom. "'If so (throwing it away), wash your mouth and
grieve not.' Verily he did so (and said to his father), 'The salt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660"> 660</span>
that I put in the water exists for ever; (though I perceive it
not by my eyes it is felt by my tongue).' (Unto him) said (his
father), 'Verily, such is the case with the Truth, my child.
Though you perceive it not, it nevertheless pervades this (body).
That particle which is the soul of all this is Truth; it is the
Universal Soul. O Swetaketu, Thou art that'" (Ch. Up., ch. vi.
sec. 13, p. 113).</p>

<p>Similar notions of an all-pervading and infinite Being are
found in the Bhagavat-Gíta, a theological episode inserted in
the great epical poem known as the Mahâbhârata. There
Vishnu is not merely the ordinary god Vishnu of Indian theology;
but the universe itself is expressed as an incarnation of
that deity who is seen in everything and himself is everything.
"I am the soul, O Arjuna," thus he addresses his mortal pupil,
"which exists in the heart of all beings, and I am the beginning
and the middle and also the end of existing things" (Bh.
G., ch. x. p. 71).</p>

<p>Again, Vishnu thus describes himself in language which
translated into ordinary prose, would serve to convey the idea
embodied in Mr. Herbert Spencer's Unknowable:—</p>

<p>"Know that that brilliance which enters the sun and illumines
the whole earth, and which is in the moon, and in fire,
is of me. And I enter the ground and support all living
things by my vigor; and I nourish all herbs, becoming that
moisture of which the peculiar property is taste. And becoming
fire, I enter the body of the living, and being associated
with their inspiration and expiration, cause food of the four
kinds to digest. And I enter the heart of each one, and from
me come memory, knowledge, and reason" (Ib., ch. xv. p. 100).</p>

<p>Nor did the writers of the Veda and the commentaries
thereupon omit to look above the concrete forms of the mythological
gods who people their Pantheon to a more comprehensive
and less comprehensible primordial Source. The gods were
unfitted to serve as explanations of the origin of the universe by
reason of the theory that they were not eternal, and that they
came into existence subsequently to the creation of the world.
The writer of a hymn in the tenth book of the Rig-Veda asserted
that "the One, which in the beginning breathed calmly, self-sustained,
is developed by ... its own inherent heat, or by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661"> 661</span>
rigorous and intense abstraction." But this Rishi avowed himself
unable to say anything of creation, or even to know whether
there was a creator. "Even its ruler in the highest heaven
may not be in possession of the great secret." Explaining this
passage, a commentator, writing at a much later date, observes
that "the last verse of the hymn declares that the ruler of the
universe knows, or that even he does not know, from what material
cause this visible world arose, and whether that material
cause exists in any definite form or not. That is to say, the
declaration that 'he knows,' is made from the stand-point of that
popular conception which distinguishes between the ruler of the
universe and the creatures over whom he rules; while the proposition
that 'he does not know' is asserted on the ground of
that highest principle which, transcending all popular conceptions,
affirms the identity of all things with the supreme Soul,
which cannot see any other existence as distinct from itself"
(O. S. T., vol. v. pp. 363, 364).</p>

<p>In this sentence the commentator correctly points out the
distinction between the Unknown Cause of philosophic thought
and the gods of popular theology, the latter being limited, and
having the universe outside of and objective to them, the former
comprehending it within itself, and having nothing objective
whatever. And he perceives apparently that these are but different
modes of conceiving the same Ultimate Essence, dependent
on the varying representative capacities of those by whom
they are employed.</p>

<p>In India, as elsewhere, this Ultimate Essence had no proper
name. Sometimes it is spoken of as "That." Thus, in a passage
quoted by Dr. Muir from the Taittirīya Brâhmana we find
the following: "This [universe] was not originally anything.
There was neither heaven, nor earth, nor atmosphere. That
being non-existent (asat) resolved 'Let me be.' That became
fervent," and so forth. Hereupon the commentator states that
"the Supreme Spirit was non-existent only in respect of name
and form, but that nevertheless it was really existing (sat)" (O.
S. T., vol. v. p. 366).</p>

<p>Prof. Max Müller, in his essay on the Veda, has observed
that after naming the several powers of nature, and worshiping
them as gods, the ancient Hindu found that there was yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662"> 662</span>
another power within him and around him for which he had no
name. This he termed in the first instance "Brahman," force,
will, wish. But when Brahman too had become a person, he
called the mysterious and impersonal power "âtman," originally
meaning breath or spirit, subsequently Self. "Atman
remained always free from myth and worship, differing in this
from Brahman (neuter), who has his temples in India even now
and is worshiped as Brahman (masculine), together with Vishnu
and Siva and other popular gods" (Chips, vol. i. pp. 70, 71).
Distinguishing these two deities, for the convenience of English
readers, as Brahm, the neuter, and Brahma, the masculine God,
it is to be observed that even the latter, who holds in theology
the function of Creator, is but little worshiped in India, and
holds no conspicuous place in the popular mind. Thus Wilson
says, "It is doubtful if Brahma was ever worshiped. Indications
of local adoration of him at Pushkara, near Ajmir, are
found in one Purana, the Brahma Purana, but in no other part
of India is there the slightest vestige of his worship" (W. W.,
vol. ii. p. 63). Elsewhere the same most competent authority
states "it might be difficult to meet with" any Brahma-worshipers
now; "exclusive adorers of this deity, and temples dedicated
to him, do not now occur perhaps in any part of India;
at the same time it is an error to suppose that public homage
is never paid to him." Hereupon he mentions a few places
where Brahma is particularly reverenced. While, however,
there may be discovered some faint traces of the worship of
Brahma the Creator, and first member of the Hindu Trinity,
there does not appear to be any worship whatever of the more
impersonal and abstract Brahm. Brahm is related to Brahma
much as the Absolute or the Unknowable of philosophy is related
to the God of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures. In the
conception of Brahm the idea of deity is pushed to the utmost
limits of which human thought is capable, and we have a being
whose very exaltation above the mythological personages who
pass for gods among the people precludes him from receiving
the adoration of any but philosophic minds. When therefore
Professor Max Müller speaks of temples dedicated to Brahm I
presume that he is speaking of the temples of Brahma, the corporeal
form of this unembodied idea. For Brahm is stated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663"> 663</span>
be "immaterial, invisible, unborn, uncreated, without beginning
or end;" to be "inapprehensible by the understanding, at least
until that is freed from the film of mortal blindness;" to be
devoid of attributes, or to have only purity, and to be "susceptible
of no interest in the acts of man or the administration of
the affairs of the universe." Conformably to these views, adds
Wilson, "no temples are erected, no prayers are even addressed
to the Supreme" (W. W., vol. ii. p. 91). Thus Brahma, the God,
is but little worshiped; Brahm, the infinite being, and âtman,
spirit, are not worshiped at all. Now Brahma, the creative and
formative power, corresponds to God the Father; while Brahm
and âtman, especially the latter, bear more resemblance to the
Holy Ghost; a fact to be especially noted in reference to the
comparison hereafter to be made between the positions occupied
by the more and the less spiritual members of the Christian
Trinity.</p>

<p>Thus we have this singular neglect of the Supreme Divinity
prevailing among ancient heathens, among modern Africans,
among Hindus of all ages, and among pre-Christian Mexicans
and Peruvians. Do Judaism, and its offshoot, Christianity,
offer no sign of a similar relegation of the highest to an invisible
background? I think they do. The evidence is not indeed
quite so simple as in the other cases. But it is deserving of
remark that the ordinary name for God in Hebrew, Elohim, is
plural, and must at one time have signified gods; while the
word which is sometimes used alone, but more commonly in
combination with it, is regarded as so sacred that the Jews in
reading the Scriptures never pronounce it, but substitute
Adonai, my lord, in its place. Owing to this ancient custom
the very sound of the word יהוה has been absolutely forgotten,
and Jehovah, by which we commonly render it, has been
merely constructed by supplying the vowels from Adonai. Now
the existence of a most holy name, but rarely used, and then
only with great reverence, is a manifestation of religious feeling
exactly corresponding to that related by Reade concerning
the African name Njambi. Suppose that with the progress of
theological dogmas and ecclesiastical usages the use of the word
Njambi should be entirely dropped, its pronunciation might then
be entirely lost (if, as in Hebrew, its vowel sounds were never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664"> 664</span>
written). And with the adoption of a monotheistic creed some
name, now belonging to an idol, might be used as synonymous
with Njambi. Now something of this kind may have happened
with the Hebrews. There can be little doubt that the Elohim
were originally gods accepted by the Hebrews as part of a
polytheistic system. Deep in the minds of Hebrew thinkers lay
the more abstract notion of a single God, more powerful and
more mysterious than the Elohim. They called him Jahveh, or
whatever else may have been the name expressed by יהוה. But
as the monotheistic view triumphed over the polytheistic, the
Elohim were adopted into the framework of the new religion,
and in a manner subordinated to Jahveh by a process of fusion.
The name of Jahveh, which must once have been in common
use, was now treated as too holy to be ever uttered by mortal
lips. The ancient God who had stood at the head of the system
of his party, was in a certain sense withdrawn from active life,
but retained as the nominal occupant of supreme authority.
Whether this account is probable or not, must be left to better
judges to decide, but it tends at least to bring the history of
the Jewish faith into harmony with that of other religions.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is interesting to observe that a process extremely
similar to that here imagined as occurring in the development
of Judaism, was actually passed through by its younger rival.
Christianity, arising in the midst of a people who had arrived
at highly abstract views of deity, proceeded at once to do what
so many other creeds have done, to embody the conception of
divine power in a concrete object. This concrete object was in
the Christian theology a man. And as generally happens in
these cases, the more abstract idea was overshadowed and to
some extent driven from the field by the more concrete. Christ
occupies a larger place both in authorized Christian worship and
in the popular Christian imagination than does his Father. The
creed no doubt treats them both with equal reverence, as persons
in a single God; but to understand what is truly felt and
believed by the people, we must look not to the letter of their
creeds, but to their actual, and above all their unconscious
practice. Doing this we find first an entire absence of any
special festival in honor of the Father.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Look at the large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665"> 665</span>
place occupied by the history of Jesus in ecclesiastical fast-days
and feast-days. We have the Annunciation, the Nativity, the
forty days of Lent, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, the Ascension,
all referring to him. But we have quite forgotten to celebrate
the creation of the human species, the expulsion from
Eden, the deluge, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
other mighty works due to his Father. The weekly holiday,
originally a memorial of his repose on the seventh day, has
indeed been retained from Judaism; yet even here its reference
has been changed from the history of the first person to that
of the second by its transfer from the last day of the week to
the first. But this is not all. Didron remarks that in early
works of art Jesus is made to take the place of his Father in
creation and in similar labors, just as in heathen religions an
inferior divinity does the work under a superior one. Dishonorable
and even ridiculous positions were assigned to God the
Father. The more ancient artists were reluctant to paint the
whole of the First Person, just as Africans, Peruvians and
Hebrews were reluctant to speak his name. A mere hand or an
arm is held sufficient to represent him. But in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, God the Father begins to manifest his
figure; at first his bust only, and then his whole person. In
the fourteenth century we take part in the birth and development
of the figure of the eternal Father. At first equal to his
Son in age and station, he begins in process of time to become
slightly different, until, towards 1360, the notion of paternity is
attached irrevocably to him; he is thenceforth uniformly older
than his Son, and assumes the first place in the Trinity. The
middle age may be divided (according to Didron) into two
periods. In the first, preceding the fourteenth century, we have
the Father in the image and similitude of the Son. In the
second, after the thirteenth century until the sixteenth, Jesus
Christ loses his iconographic distinctness, and is conquered by
his Father. He in his turn puts on the likeness of the Father,
becoming old and wrinkled like him (Ic. Ch., p. 148-203). Basing
his conclusions on these remarkable disclosures, Michelet, in
his "History of France," observes with considerable reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666"> 666</span>
that from the first century until the twelfth God was not worshiped
by Christians. Nay, even for fifteen centuries not a temple,
not an altar was erected to him. And when he did venture
to appear beside his Son in Christian art, he remained neglected
and solitary. Nobody made an offering to him, or caused a
mass to be said in his honor (Michelet, "Histoire de France,"
vol. vii. p. xlix).</p>

<p>But while the first Person of the Trinity has now obtained,
especially in Protestant countries, a degree of recognition which
he did not always enjoy, there remains behind another Person,
who is more abstract, more spiritual, more undefinable than
either the Father or the Son. Formally included in the liturgies
of the Church, having an office established in his honor,
churches dedicated to his name, this member of the Trinity has
nevertheless been strangely neglected by all Christian nations.
Nobody practically worships the Holy Ghost; nobody pays him
especial attention; nobody appears to be much concerned about
his proceedings. Artists have treated him with a degree of indifference
which they have never manifested towards Jesus
Christ. Not only have they sometimes forgotten to include the
Holy Ghost in their representations of the Godhead, but they
have omitted him even from a scene where he had the best possible
claim to figure, namely, the reception of the Spirit by the
apostles at the feast of Pentecost. Elsewhere they have not
completely left him out, but have placed him in an attitude of
subordination and indignity, evincing but scant respect, as
where an artist had depicted an angel as apparently restraining
the impetuosity of the dove by holding its tail in both his
hands. While in the Catacombs it was the Father who was
suppressed, in the Trinities of the twelfth, fifteenth, and sixteenth
centuries it is the Holy Ghost who is found to be missing.
"Thus," observes the Roman Catholic author to whom I
am indebted for these facts, "the Holy Ghost has sometimes
had reason to complain of the artists" (Ic. Ch., p. 489-495).</p>

<p>Were this Person, in fact, disposed to be punctilious, it is not
only artists, mere reflectors of the general sentiment, but the
whole Christian world of whom he would have reason to complain.
So little does he occupy the ordinary thoughts of Christians,
that Abailard gave the greatest offense by naming a mon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667"> 667</span>astery
after him, and this procedure of the great theologian
remains, I believe, a solitary example in ecclesiastical history
of such an honor being paid to the Paraclete. Yet surely he
who bears the great office of the Comforter is deserving of some
more express recognition than he now receives! What is the
cause of this universal oblivion? I suspect it is that which
leads to the neglect by the Africans of their highest god,
namely, his entire innocuousness. We saw that various tribes,
while omitting to worship a benevolent deity, who will never
do them any kind of harm, address their prayers to a class of
gods who are described by travelers as demons, or evil spirits,
but whom they no doubt regard as mixtures of good qualities
with bad; capable of propitiation by prayer, but resentful of
irreverence. Now the Father and the Son correspond in some
degree to these inferior gods. Not that they are actively malevolent,
but they have certain characteristics of a terrifying order.
God the Father is throughout the Bible the author of chastisements
and scourges. God the son, merciful though he be, yet
intimates that he will return to judge the world, and that he
will disavow those who are not truly his disciples, thus consigning
them to the secular arm of God the Father, who will
condemn them to eternal punishment. But God the Spirit has
no share in these horrors. Whenever he appears upon the
scene, he is quiet, gentle, and inoffensive; and these qualities,
combined with the absence of the more definite personality
possessed by his colleagues, have effectually ensured his comparative
insignificance in Christian worship and in Christian
thought.</p>

<p>While this has been the course of affairs in reference to the
persons in the Trinity—who, though dogmatically one, are
popularly and practically three—a simultaneous displacement
of all its members by still more comprehensible objects of worship
has been going on. First in rank among these stands the
Virgin Mary, so universally worshiped in Catholic countries.
After her come the mass of saints, some of general, some of
local celebrity; but who, no doubt, receive, each from his or
her particular devotees, a far larger share of devotional attention
than the Father or the Son themselves. For they are
requested to intercede with these more exalted potentates; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668"> 668</span>
we naturally pay more regard to our intercessors, show them
more assiduous respect, feel towards them more gratitude, than
we do to those with whom they intercede, and who stand too
far above us to be approached directly by us. Keightley, in his
"History of England," expresses himself as shocked by the far
larger share of the offerings of the pious received at Canterbury
by the altar of Thomas-à-Becket than was received by the
altars of the Virgin and of the Son. The proportion is as follows:—In
one year St. Thomas received £832, 12s. 3d.; the
Virgin £63, 5s. 6d.; Christ only £3, 2s. 6d. Next year the martyr
had £954, 6s. 3d.; Mary £4, 1s. 8d.; and Christ nothing at
all. This relation is perfectly natural. Thomas-à-Becket was
the local saint. He stood nearer to the people, was more intelligible
to their minds, than the Virgin Mary; and the latter,
again, was more intelligible to them than Jesus Christ, whose
mystic attributes she did not share. This fact does but illustrate
the common tendency of mankind to neglect the worship
of the highest deity recognized in their formal creed, and to
offer their prayers and their sacrifices to idols of lower pretensions
and more human proportions.</p>

<p>That which, as the upshot of these speculations, we are
chiefly concerned to note, is that religion everywhere contains,
as its most essential ingredient, the conception of an unknown
power; which power, thus offered by religion to the adoration
of mankind, becomes the object of a double tendency: a tendency
on the one hand to preserve it as a dim idea, represented
to the mind under highly abstract forms; a tendency on the
other hand, to bring it down to common comprehension by presenting
it to the senses under concrete symbols. But under all
images, however material; under all embodiments, however
gross; the central thought of a power hidden behind sensible
phenomena, unknown and unknowable, still remains.</p>

<p>So far then as historical inquiry throws light upon the
answer to the second question in the previous chapter, that
answer will be in the affirmative. It renders it at least highly
probable that the common elements of religion are, from their
universal or all but universal prevalence, "a necessary and
therefore permanent portion of our mental furniture." Nor is
this conclusion invalidated by the hypothetical objection that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669"> 669</span>
there are races without a religion at all. Granting the fact, it
admits of an explanation quite consistent with this view. For
the races which are destitute of the religious idea may be so,
not because they are superior to it, and can do without it, but
because they are inferior to it, and have not yet perceived it.
Thus, the savage nations who cannot count beyond their fingers,
prove nothing against the necessity of numerical relations.
Even though they cannot add their ten toes to their ten fingers,
and thus make twenty, yet the moment we perceive that ten
plus ten equals twenty, we perceive also that this relation is
an absolute necessity, and it remains an unalterable fact in our
intellectual treasury. No inability on the part of the savage to
understand us can shake our conviction. Now the same thing
may hold good of the ultimate elements of religious feeling.
These also, when once the conditions are realized in thought,
may prove necessary beliefs. Whether they are so or not is a
question for philosophy. To the examination of that question
we must now proceed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Religion, as the foregoing analysis has shown, puts forward
as its cardinal truth the conception of a power which is neither
perceptible by the senses nor definable by the intellect. For
sensible perception requires a material object and a material
organ; and intellectual definition requires an object which can
be compared with other objects that are like it, discriminated
from others that are unlike it, and classified according to that
likeness and that unlikeness. In either case therefore the
object must be a phenomenon having its place among phenomena,
whether those of the sensible or those of the intelligible
sphere. But if the power accepted by religion be neither perceptible
nor definable, are we obliged to believe in the existence
of so abstract an entity at all, or may we reject it as a figment
of the human brain?</p>

<p>Perhaps we shall best be able to discover whether such a
belief is necessary or not by endeavoring to do without it, and
to frame a consistent conception of the universe from which it
is entirely excluded.</p>

<p>There are various ways in which such a conception might be
attempted. We may regard the world from the platform of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670"> 670</span>
Realism or from that of Idealism, and the nature of our Realism
or of our Idealism may vary with the special school of thought
to which we may belong. Realism in the first instance admits
of two main subdivisions: into Common, or as Mr. Spencer calls
it, Crude Realism, and into Metaphysical Realism; and these
two forms of it require separate treatment.</p>

<p>Common Realism is the primitive opinion of uneducated and
of unreflecting persons, and is in fact simply the absence of any
genuine opinion at all. They, I imagine, regard the external
objects by which they are surrounded as so many actual entities,
not only having an independent existence of their own, but
an existence like that which they possess in our consciousness.
Thus, an egg they would take to be in reality a white, brittle,
hard thing on the outside, having a certain shape, size, and
weight, and containing inside the shell a quantity of soft whitish
and yellowish substance with a given taste. These qualities,
not excepting the taste, taken along with any other qualities
that may be disclosed by more careful inquiry, they would conceive
to constitute the whole of the egg. It is the same with
other objects. What we perceive by our senses is thought by
them to be a copy of the real things as they exist in nature,
much as the retina of the eye, regarded from without, is seen to
contain a copy in miniature of the surrounding scene. Common
Realism, however, while it tacitly takes for granted an
infinite number of separate entities, cannot account either for
the origin of those entities or for their nature. Nor has it any
account to give of the origin of life, for material things are in
this system utterly destitute of life, and indeed opposed to it.
They are precisely what our senses inform us of, and nothing
more. Hence they furnish no answers to the questions: How
did this world come into being, and how did it reach its present
shape? How do men come to exist in it; for matter contains
no vitality and no power of infusing vitality into itself? Therefore
it is that the adherents of Common Realism are invariably
driven back upon a superior being, whom they term a Creator,
and who supplies the motive impulse which is wanting in their
world.</p>

<p>Metaphysical Realism professes to be the improvement of
scholars upon the unsifted notions of the vulgar. It is the sys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671"> 671</span>tem
to which, in its earlier and cruder form, Berkeley a century
ago gave what once appeared to be its death-blow, but what
may perhaps turn out to have been a wound sufficiently severe
to cause prolonged insensibility, but not absolute extinction.
It is not, however, with the purpose of completing the work of
destruction, but of examining whether it affords a possible
escape from the necessity of the religious postulate, that I refer
to it here. Metaphysical Realists perceived clearly enough that
the apparent qualities of sensible objects could not be the
objects themselves. Even if they did not recognize this with
regard to all the apparent qualities, they did so with regard to
those termed "secondary," such as taste, smell, and color.
Later representatives of the school, such as Kant, extended the
process by which this conclusion was reached to all apparent
qualities, whatsoever. Below the apparent qualities, however,
these thinkers assumed a substance, "<i>substantia</i>," in which
they inhered, and by which they were bound together, so
as to constitute the object. And this substance—something
unperceived underlying the qualities perceived—was their
notion of matter. Observe now the position we have arrived
at. No sooner does Realism abandon the untenable hypothesis
that the qualities of the object are the object itself,
than it is driven upon the assumption of an utterly unknowable
and inconceivable entity; a matter which is not perceptible by
any of our senses, which is below, or in addition to, phenomena
concerning which we can predicate nothing, and whose relation
to the qualities it is supposed to support we cannot understand.
But the necessity of some such assumption is the very assertion
implied in all forms of religious faith. Realism, then, does not
escape the pressure of this necessity, even though the entity it
assumes is not precisely of the same character.</p>

<p>But is the difference in its character one that tells in favor
of this variety of Realism, or in favor of religion? Assuredly
substance, or matter, imagined as the bond between apparent
qualities, is not an easier, simpler, or more intelligible conception
than that of a universal power as the origin, source, or
objective side of all physical phenomena. Granting even that
the latter conception cannot be represented to the mind, a representation
of the former is equally impossible. But does it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672"> 672</span>
explain the facts better? Let us see. In the first place, we
must demand an accurate definition of what this supposed matter
is. Is it passive, inanimate, incapable of independent action,
and unable to develop out of itself the living creatures which
in some way have come to exist? If so, we plainly require another
entity in addition to matter, both to account for the active
forces of our universe, and to originate the phenomenon of life.
For if the qualities of body need a substratum, so also do those
of mind. If it be held that the power from which mind emanates
be the same as that which is evinced in so-called physical
forces, then we have two distinct, if not independent, substances,
beings, or whatever we may prefer to call them: matter,
pervading material objects in their statical condition, and
force or life, pervading both consciousness and material objects
in their dynamical condition. Or if the first be regarded as
sufficient to account for motion as well as matter, then we have
still two powers, one subsisting throughout the physical, the
other throughout the mental world. How are these two substances
related to one another? Is the substance of mind
supreme, governing its material colleague? or is that of matter
at the head of affairs, and that of mind subordinate? or are
they equal and coördinate authorities, as in the Gnostic philosophy?
Suppose we endeavor to elude these difficulties by the
assertion that there is nothing else but the unperceivable substratum
supporting material objects, and that in this all modes
of existence take their rise, we are met by further and still
more troublesome questions. For if, under the manifestations
of this substance we include consciousness, then the distinction
between matter and mind has vanished, and in calling this substance
matter we are simply giving it an unmeaning name. In
fact, it is a substance supporting not only the qualities of
bodies, but also the chemical, electric, molar, molecular, and
other forces throughout the universe, as well as sensation,
thought, and emotion. Matter in short does everything which
deity can be required to do; it originates motion; it produces
living creatures; it feels; it thinks; it lives. Thus we have but
stumbled upon God in an unexpected quarter. Suppose, however,
that we take what is in this system the easier and more
natural hypothesis of a substance of matter, a substance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673"> 673</span>
mind, and a still more hidden power superior to both, and from
which both are derived, then we have but abandoned the perplexing
questions raised by metaphysical Realism to take refuge
in the religious position from which it seemed to offer a plausible
deliverance.</p>

<p>Does Idealism help us? Idealism is of several forms. That
represented by Berkeley need not occupy us here, for Berkeley
not only admitted, but expressly asserted, the existence of an
all-comprehending Power, and without this his philosophy
would have appeared to himself unmeaning and incomprehensible.
Nor need we stop to examine that more recent species of
Idealism, as I hold it to be, which its illustrious author, Mr. Herbert
Spencer, has christened Transfigured Realism. Whatever
differences may exist between Spencer and Berkeley—and I
believe them to be more apparent than real—they are at one
in the cardinal doctrine that sensible phenomena are but the
varied manifestations of this ultimate Power. All such Idealism
as this is in harmony with religion. But there are two forms
which seem to be at variance with it, one of which I will term
Moderate, and the other Extreme Idealism.</p>

<p>Moderate Idealism agrees with Berkeley in dismissing to the
limbo of extinct metaphysical creatures the substance supposed
to lurk beneath the apparent qualities of bodies. It holds that
there is no such substance, and that these qualities, and therefore
bodies themselves, exist only in consciousness. But it differs
from Berkeley in omitting to provide any source whatever,
external to ourselves, from which these bodies can be derived.
Not only are they in their phenomenal aspect mere states of
our own consciousness, but they have no other aspect than the
phenomenal one, and are in themselves nothing but phenomena.
Rather inconsistently, this school of Idealism does not
push its reasoning to its natural results, but concedes to other
human beings something more than a merely phenomenal
existence. Nothing exists but states of consciousness; but those
peculiar states of my consciousness which I term men and
women may be shown, by careful reasoning, to possess (in all
probability) an existence of their own, even apart from my seeing,
hearing, or feeling them. The process by which we reach
this conclusion "is exactly parallel to that by which Newton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674"> 674</span>
proved that the force which keeps the planets in their orbits is
identical with that by which an apple falls to the ground."<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Those peculiar modifications of color, and that special mode
of filling up empty space which I term "my friend," do indeed
seem, if we push matters to an extreme, to come into existence
only when he enters my room, and to cease to exist the
moment he quits it. If he has any further vitality, it is only
in the shape of that state of consciousness which is known as
recollection. But Moderate Idealism escapes from this consequence,
on the ground that modifications of body and outward
actions, since they are connected with feelings in ourselves,
must be connected with feelings also in the case of those other
phenomena which we term human beings, and perhaps in the
case of those we term animals.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> But if this be so, how did so
extraordinary a fact as that of consciousness arise? <i>Ex hypothesi</i>,
there was nothing before it. Did it then suddenly spring
into being, full-grown like Minerva, but, unlike Minerva, with
no head of Jupiter to spring from? Or was it a gradual growth,
and if so, from what origin? Go back as far as you will, you
can find nothing but consciousness, and that the consciousness
of limited beings (either men or animals); and it is no less
difficult to conceive the beginning, from nothing at all, of the
least atom of conscious life, than to conceive that of the profoundest
philosopher. Observe, there is no world of any kind,
and in this no-world (the contradiction is unavoidable) there
suddenly arises, from no antecedent, a consciousness of external
objects which are no-objects. Geology upon this theory is a
myth; so is that branch of astronomy which treats of the formation
of our planetary system from nebular matter. Stars,
suns, planets, and crust of the earth only arose when they were
perceived, and will cease to be when there is no living creature
to perceive them any longer. Since, however, conclusions like
these are in reality unthinkable, whatever efforts metaphysicians
may make to think them, Moderate Idealism must of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675"> 675</span>
necessity complete its fabric by the admission of a Power from
which both consciousness and the objects of consciousness have
taken their rise. Should it persist in denying anything but a
mental reality to the objects of consciousness, it must still suppose
an unknown source from which consciousness itself has
been derived; otherwise it will entangle itself in two unthinkable
propositions. First, that before men (or animals) existed
there was absolute nothingness, an idea which we cannot frame;
secondly, that where there was nothing at one moment there
was the next moment something, a process which we <i>cannot</i>
realize without supposing a time antecedent to that something,
and which we <i>may not</i>, without the contradiction of introducing
time in the midst of nothingness, realize by supposing a time
antecedent to that something.</p>

<p>It was no doubt the vague feeling of these perplexities that
forced John Stuart Mill, the most eminent defender of this
school of thought, to denominate matter a Permanent Possibility
of Sensation. This singular phrase well exemplifies the
difficulties of his position. For is matter an external substance,
existing independently, or not? If it is, then what becomes of
the Berkeleyan doctrine? Mill and his followers are simply
metaphysical Realists. But if not, what becomes of the permanence?
It is not in us, for our sensations are not permanent;
it is not in the matter, for there is none. And what is there a
possibility of? Causing sensation, or having it? Not the former,
for there is nothing to cause it; not the latter, for the
possibility of our having sensations is a mere fact of our nature,
and cannot serve to define matter. And where is the sensation
located? The phraseology would seem to imply, that matter
is in the permanent condition of possible feeling; just as the
nerve may be in the permanent condition of possible excitation.
But this would be placing sensation in the wrong quarter. And
if sensation be in us, we have not a permanent possibility, but
a permanent actuality of sensation. So that unless the words
be construed to mean that there is outside of us a permanent
something which excites sensation, of which the modes vary (for
this is the sense of possibility), they have no assignable meaning
whatever. Mill, in fact, had been compelled, without wishing
it, to recognize an ultimate power in nature; and his per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676"> 676</span>ception
of this truth conflicted strangely, in his candid mind,
with his idealistic prepossessions.</p>

<p>A more consistent and rigorous form of Idealism is that which
has been referred to as the strict consequence of Moderate
Idealism. This form, which I will term Extreme Idealism,
denies the existence of persons as well as things. The Extreme
Idealist believes himself to be the only being in the
universe. There is to him no period preceding his own existence;
none succeeding it. Past and future, except in his own
life, have no meaning for him. We cannot reason with him,
for all we may say is only a transient mode of his own sensations.
Obviously, to such a philosophy there is no reply but
one: it is simply unthinkable. Were any one seriously to defend
it, the very seriousness of his defense would prove that he did
not believe it. For against what or whom would he be contending?
Against a phantom of his own mind. And the more
pains he took to prove to us that he believed us to have no
existence but as a part of himself, the less credit should we
attach to his assertions.</p>

<p>Philosophy, therefore, is under a logical compulsion to make
the same fundamental assumption as Religion—that of an ultimate,
unknown, and all-pervading Power Origin, or Cause.
Science, in a variety of ways, does the same. It does so, first,
in its belief of a past and a future in the history of the solar
system far transcending the past and future of humanity, or
indeed of any form of life whatever. Passing at a glance over
our brief abode on the face of the earth, Geology pushes its
researches back into a time preceding by innumerable ages the
existence of mankind, while her elder sister Astronomy carries
her vision to a still remoter age, when even the planet we now
inhabit was but a fragment in one indistinguishable mass. But
it is not only these two sciences that assume the continuance
of nature quite independently of our presence or absence; every
other science does the like. The botanist, the chemist, the
physicist, all believe that the facts they assert are facts in an
external nature, the relations of which as now discovered by
their several sciences held good before man existed, and will
hold good after he has ceased to exist. But to say this, is to
say in effect that there is something more than the mere phe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677"> 677</span>nomena
disclosed by investigation; namely, an external reality
persisting through all time in which the varied series of phenomena
take their rise.</p>

<p>More clearly still does Science assert some such reality in its
great modern doctrine of the Persistence of Force. Not that
this doctrine is entirely new; for regarded in its metaphysical
rather than its physical aspect it is but an expression in the
language of the day of a truth which has long been realized as
a necessity of thought. It is the converse of the ancient axiom,
"<i>Nihil ex nihilo fit</i>," for if nothing can be made from nothing,
neither can something pass into nothing. The Persistence of
Force is an expression of the fact that every cause must have
an adequate effect; that in nature nothing can be lost, no particle
of force pass into nonentity. Concentrated forces may be
dissipated, and dissipated forces may be concentrated; or one
variety of force may pass into another. But the ultimate fund
of force remains ever unchangeable; nothing is ever created,
nothing destroyed.</p>

<p>Observe, then, that Science, however cautiously it may keep
within the range of the material world, however eagerly it may
repudiate all investigation of ultimate causes as fruitless and
unprofitable, cannot take one single step towards proving the
propositions it advances without tacitly laying down an ontological
entity as the basis of its demonstration. For to speak of
its discoveries as laws of nature is simply to predicate a constant,
unvarying force, which under like conditions always produces
like results. And to declare the uniformity of nature, is
merely to say that the methods of that force do not change—that
it is the same now as it ever was, and will be the same
throughout the eternal ages.</p>

<p>"Thus," writes Mr. Herbert Spencer, "by the Persistence of
Force, we really mean the persistence of some Power which
transcends our knowledge and conception. The manifestations,
as occurring in ourselves or outside of us, do not persist; but
that which persists is the Unknown Cause of these manifestations.
In other words, asserting the Persistence of Force, is but
another mode of asserting an Unconditional Reality, without
beginning or end" (Spencer's "First Principles," § 60, p. 189).</p>

<p>Philosophy, or Reasoned Thought, and Science, or Reasoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678"> 678</span>
Observation, have both led us to admit, as a fundamental principle,
the necessary existence of an unknown, inconceivable, and
omnipresent Power, whose operations are ever in progress
before our eyes, but whose nature is, and can never cease to be,
an impenetrable mystery. And this is the cardinal truth of all
religion. From all sides then, by every mode of contemplation,
we are forced upon the same irresistible conclusion. The final
question still remains, Is this ultimate element of all religion
"the correlative of any actual truth or not?"</p>

<p>But for the prevalence, in recent times, of a philosophy which
denies all connection between the necessity of a belief and its
truth, I should have regarded such a question as scarcely worth
the answering. To say that a belief is necessary and to say
that it is true, would appear to all, but adherents of the
extreme experiential school, one and the same thing. But in
the present day this cannot be taken for granted, and I should
be the last to complain that even that which seems most
obvious should be tested by adverse criticism.</p>

<p>Ingenious, however, as their arguments are, philosophers of
this school, when driven to reason out their views, cut their own
throats. They commit a logical suicide. For what is the test
of truth they hold up to us in lieu of necessity? Experience.
But what in the last resort does our belief in experience rest
upon? Simply upon a mental necessity. Nobody can tell us
<i>why</i> he believes that the laws of nature will hold good to-morrow
as they do to-day. He can indeed tell us that he has
always found them constant before, and therefore expects them
to remain so. But this is merely to state the belief, not to
justify it. Experience itself cannot be appealed to, to support
our confidence in experience. True, we habitually say that we
believe such and such results will follow such and such antecedents
<i>because</i> we have always found them follow before. But
our past experience is not the whole of the fact involved in the
belief. It is our past experience, conjoined with the mental
necessity of thinking that the future will resemble the past,
that forms the convictions on which we act. Experience alone,
without that mental necessity, could teach us nothing. If
therefore our necessary beliefs need not be true, the belief in
experience falls to the ground along with the rest, and expe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679"> 679</span>rience
cannot be put in place of necessity as a test of truth.
In fact, every argument drawn from the past fallibility of the
test of necessity might be retorted with tenfold force against
the test of experience. Observation has constantly misled mankind,
and thousands of alleged facts, accepted upon imagined
experience, have been disproved by more accurate examination.
Observation and reasoning combined (as they often are) are
exposed to the double danger of false premises and false inferences
from true premises; while the addition of an element of
testimony (a circumstance common in scientific inquiries) exposes
every conclusion to a threefold possibility of error. Human
beings are no more exempt from the possibility of mistaken
science than from that of hasty metaphysics. But as, in matters
of physical research, we do not discredit the use of our
eyes because their perceptions are sometimes inaccurate, so in
matters of metaphysical inquiry we need not discredit the use
of our minds because their apparent intuitions are now and
then fallacious. In the one case, as in the other, the proper
course is not to cast contempt upon the only instruments of discovery
we have, but to apply those instruments again and
again, omitting no precaution that may serve to correct an observation
and to test an argument. But when we have done our
utmost to attain whatever certainty the nature of the subject
permits, we cannot reasonably turn round upon ourselves and
say: "True, my eyes assure me of this fact, but human eyes
have erred so often that I cannot accept their verdict;" or,
"No doubt my mind forces this conclusion upon me as a necessity
of thought, but so many assumed necessities have turned
out not to be necessary at all that I must refuse to listen to
my mind:" for this is not really the caution of science, but the
rashness of philosophic theory. For we can have no higher
conviction than that arising in a necessity of thought. Nothing
can surpass the certainty of this. Grant that we may yet be
wrong: we can never know it, and we can have no reason to
think it. To oppose to a necessary belief such a train of reasoning
as this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Necessary beliefs (so-called) have often proved false:</li>
<li>This is a necessary belief (so-called):</li>
<li>Therefore it may prove false,</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_680"> 680</span></p>


<p class="pnind">is in reality to seek to overthrow a strong conviction by a weak
one; an intuition by a syllogism; a proposition felt immediately
to be true by an inference open to discussion. Arguments
like this resemble the procedure of a man who should tell us,
when we meet a friend, that we cannot possibly be sure of his
identity because on some previous occasion in our lives we mistook
Jones for Thompson.</p>

<p>Exaggerated as this doctrine of the experiential school is
thus seen to be, yet it has done good service by putting thinkers
on their guard, not to accept as necessary and ultimate some
beliefs which are only contingent and dissoluble. Two conditions
must be fulfilled in order to effect a presumption of necessity.
The belief must always arise under certain conditions;
that is, it must be universal in the only sense in which that
term can fitly be applied. Having arisen, it must be incapable
of expulsion from the mind; its terms must adhere together so
firmly that they cannot be parted by adverse criticism, either
our own or that of others. Both these conditions are fulfilled
by the fundamental postulate of religion. Given the appropriate
conditions—human beings raised even a little above the
lowest savagery—and it at once takes possession of their
minds. After this, it persists in spite of every attempt to do
without it, and the highest philosophy is compelled to give it
the place of honor in the forefront of its teaching.</p>

<p>Observe now, that what this philosophy accepts and incorporates
into its system is religion and not theology. These two
must be broadly distinguished from one another. Religion might
be described as the soul of which theology is the body. Religion
is an abstract, indefinable, pervading sentiment; theology a
concrete, well-defined, limited creed. The one is emotional; the
other intellectual. The one is a constant element of our nature;
the other fluctuates from generation to generation, and varies
from place to place. Theology seeks to bind down religion with
immovable forms. Against these forms there is constantly
arising both an intellectual and an emotional protest. The
intellect objects to them as untrue in the name of science (in
the largest sense); the emotions struggle against them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681"> 681</span>
cramping their freedom in the name of religion itself. Thus
between the human mind and dogma, between the religious
sentiment and dogma, there is going on a perpetual warfare.
Religious sentiment is no sooner born than the tendency to
limit and to define makes itself felt. It is confined within a
set of dogmas, and forbidden under every species of pains and
penalties to pass over its allotted bounds. Sooner or later,
religious sentiment bursts through every restriction; seems for
a moment to breathe the invigorating air of freedom, but falls
again into the hands of new theologians, with another framework
of dogmas; to be again broken through in its turn when
its fettering influence can be no longer borne. In carrying on
this continually renovated contest—which is seen in its highest
activity in great religious reformations—the religious sentiment
seeks the alliance of intellect, which latter supplies it with
deadly weapons drawn from the armories of science, logic, and
historical research. Thus the overthrow of theology is in great
part an intellectual work. But it must not be forgotten that
the very deepest hostility to theological systems is inspired by
the very emotion to which these systems seek to give a formal
and definite expression.</p>

<p>The historical progress of religion is thus in some degree a
counterpart of the progress described by Heine (in the lines
heading this Book) as that of his individual mind. First of all
there arises in the mind of man, so soon as he begins to speculate
on the world in which he lives, the idea of a Creator. He
cannot conceive the existence of the material objects with which
he is familiar without conceiving also some being more powerful
than himself who has made them what they are. His
notions of creation may be, no doubt often are, extremely limited.
He may confine the operations of his God to that small
portion of the universe with which he is most familiar. But
that the idea of an invisible yet preëminent deity arises very
early in the mental development of the human race, and
remains brooding dimly above the popular idolatry, has been
abundantly shown. This is the belief in God the Father. The
second stage, so closely interwoven with the first as to be
inseparable from it in actual history, is the incarnation of this
idea. The supreme Creator is too lofty, too abstract, too great,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682"> 682</span>
to be held steadily before the mind and worshiped in his
unclouded glory. The children of Israel cannot bear the immediate
presence of Jehovah, nor can even Moses meet the brightness
of his face. Hence the material shapes in which the
objects of adoration are embodied. When divine attributes are
given to idols; when a golden calf is taken instead of the invisible
God; when the Father is said to assume the form of a
man to live a human life, and die a human death, when apostles,
saints, and virgins are addressed in prayer or celebrated in
praise, an incarnation has occurred. In the language of the
traditions we have quoted, the supreme God has gone away and
left the government of the world to his inferiors. Practically,
such incarnations belong to the earliest period of religion, and
no popular creed has ever been entirely without them. No
sooner is the religious idea conceived in the mind, than it begins
to be clothed in flesh and bones. But in the order of thought
these two stages are separable. For idols are not worshiped
until the notion of some power which is not human, of which
the nature is not understood, has arisen in the worshipers.
Then a concrete expression is desired, and we have in poetical
language the belief in God the Son.</p>

<p>Last of all comes the belief—more properly an emotion than
a belief—in the Holy Spirit. With this step a far higher grade
of religious sentiment is reached. For God is now conceived,
not only as creating or as governing the world without, but as
entering into the mind of man to inspire his actions and influence
his heart. A relation which up to this point was merely external—like
that of the Creator to the created, or of superior to
inferior—is rendered internal and intimate. The Holy Spirit
not only speaks <i>to</i> our souls, but it speaks in them and through
them. We receive, not the arbitrary command of an almighty
potentate, but the inspiring force of a being who, while raising
us above ourselves, is still a part, the best part, of ourselves.
This indeed, in the deep imagination of the poet, makes all
men noble.</p>

<p>Yet not in such a creed as this, sublime as it is in comparison
with those that have gone before it, is the final resting-place
of religious feeling. For every word or phrase in which
we endeavor to give form to that feeling tends to lower and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683"> 683</span>
corrupt it by the admixture of elements which are foreign to
its genuine nature. To clothe this sentiment in language is
itself an incarnation. For whether we speak of a Force, a Power,
or a Spirit, of an ultimate Cause, or an all-pervading Essence;
of the Absolute, or of the Reality beyond phenomena, these terms
are but symbols of the Supreme, not the Supreme itself.</p>

<p>All that we can say is, that while we <i>know</i> nothing but that
which either our senses perceive, or our minds understand, we
<i>feel</i> that there is something more. Both the world without and
the world within, both that which is perceived and that which
perceives, require an origin beyond themselves. Both compel
us to look, as their common source, to a Being alike unknown
and unknowable, whose nature is shrouded in a mystery no eye
can pierce, and no intellect can fathom.</p>

<p>This is the great truth which religion has presented to philosophy,
and which philosophy, if she be truly (as her name
implies) the love of wisdom, will not disdain to incorporate with
the more recently discovered treasures belonging to her peculiar
sphere. For it is not the part of wisdom to spurn as worthless
even the childish lispings prompted by the profound idea that
has inspired the faith of men, from that of the far past to that
of the present hour, from that of the rudest African to that of
the most enlightened European. Rather is it the part of wisdom
to excavate that idea from amidst the strange incrustations
under which it is hidden, to understand its significance, and to
recognize its value. Thus may we assign to it a fitting place
within the limits of a system which does equal honor, and
accords equal rights, to the scientific faculty and to the emotional
instinct.</p>

<small>THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT.</small></h3></div>


<p>When speaking of the fundamental postulates involved in the
religious idea, we pointed out that, besides the unknown cause
of physical phenomena, "every religion assumes also that there
is in human nature something equally hyperphysical with the
object which it worships, whether we call this something soul,
or mind, or spirit." Let us call it soul. And first let us examine
what it is that religion says of the soul, after which we may
be in a position to consider what degree of truth, if any, is involved
in its assertions.</p>

<p>Now the great fact which presents itself to our notice in this
inquiry is the broad line of demarcation which religion has
everywhere drawn between the mental and corporeal functions
of man, or in other words, between his soul and his body.
Generally, it expresses this grand distinction by the assertion
that the soul continues to live after the body is dissolved. This
doctrine is very ancient and very wide-spread. A few illustrations
of its prevalence are all that can be given here.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The rude people of Kamtschatka, who had so little notion of
a providence, believed in a subterranean life after death. The
soul they thought was immortal, and the body would at some
time rejoin it, when the two would live on together, much as
they do here but under happier conditions. Their place of
abode was to be under the earth, where there was another
earth resembling ours. Some of them objected to being baptized,
because they would then be compelled to meet their enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685"> 685</span>
the Russians, instead of living among their own people under
ground. Animals too were all of them to live again (Kamtschatka,
p. 269-273). The Tartars, when visited by Carpin, had
some notion that after death they would enjoy another life
where they would perform the same actions as in this (Bergeron,
vol. i. art. 3, p. 32). "The most intelligent Greenlanders,"
writes a traveler among that people, "assert that the soul is a
spiritual being quite different from the body and from all matter,
that requires no material nourishment, and while the body
is decaying in the ground, lives after death and needs a nourishment
that is not corporeal, but which they do not know"
(H. G., p. 242). The American Indians firmly believed in the
immortality of the soul. They thought it would keep the same
tendencies after death as the living man had evinced; hence
their custom—one that is widely spread—of burying the property
of the dead along with the body. The souls were obliged
after death to take a long journey, at the end of which they
arrived at their appropriate places of suffering and enjoyment.
The Paradise of virtuous Indians consisted in the very definite
pleasures of good hunting and fishing, eternal spring, abundance
of everything with no work, and all the satisfactions of the
senses (N. F., tome 3, p. 351-353). The Kafirs, as we have already
seen, worship their ancestors, whose "Amadhlozi," or spirits,
they believe to continue in existence after death. What they
mean by Amadhlozi they explain with tolerable clearness by
saying that they are identical with the shadow. These spirits
are the true objects of a Kafir's worship, being supposed to
possess great power over the affairs of their descendants and
relatives for weal or woe. They are believed to reappear in the
form of a certain species of harmless snakes, and should a man
observe such a snake on the grave of his deceased relation, he
will say, "Oh, I have seen him to-day basking on the top of
the grave" (R. S. A., pt. 2, p. 142.—K. N., pp. 161,162). Similar
reverence for the dead is shown in other parts of Africa. In
his lecture on the Ashantees, Mr. Reade says that, "on the
death of a member of the household he is sometimes buried
under the floor of the hut, in the belief that his spirit may
occasionally join in the circle of the living. Food also is placed
upon the grave, for they think that as the body of man con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686"> 686</span>tains
an indwelling spirit, so there exists in the corruptible
food an immaterial essence on which the ghost of the departed
will feed."</p>

<p>To come to races standing higher in the scale of civilization:
the Peruvians had definite notions of a future state, with an
upper world in which the good lived a quiet life, free from
trouble, and a lower world in which the bad were punished by
suffering all the miseries and troubles of this terrestrial condition
without intermission (C. R., b. 2, ch. vii). In China the
utmost respect is paid to deceased progenitors, who are the
objects of a regular <i>cultus</i>. India has had from early ages its
highly-developed and subtle notions of the distinction of spirit
from body, and the former is held to prolong its existence after
its separation from the latter, both as disembodied in heavens
or hells, and embodied in animals or other men. Some schools
believed in the immortality of the soul; others asserted that its
final destination was extinction. Buddhism ranged itself with
the latter opinion, while still maintaining the doctrine of
metempsychosis, and of rewards and punishments both in this
world and in numerous others to which spirits went in the
course of their wanderings. Parsee souls hover about the
grave a few days; then proceed upon a long journey. At its
conclusion they pass over a narrow bridge, which the good
traverse in safety to enter Paradise, while the bad fall over it
and go into hell. In the Mussulman faith there are likewise
but two destinies open to man—eternal happiness and eternal
suffering. Among the Jews in the time of Christ two doctrines
prevailed. Their ancient religion, while aware of the distinction
between the spirit and the body, left the continued life of the
former an open question. Hence the Pharisees asserted, while
the Sadducees denied, a future state. Christ was in this respect
a Pharisee of the Pharisees. He, however, like Mahomet, provided
only two abodes for the souls of men; one in heaven with
his Father, the other in hell, where the fire was never quenched.
It was felt, however, by the general Christian world that this
sharp separation of all mankind into black and white, goats
and sheep, was quite untenable. Hence the Catholic institution
of Purgatory, which, whatever may be said against it, is a wise
and liberal modification of the harsh doctrine of Christ, afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687"> 687</span>ing
a resource for the vast intermediate mass who are neither
wholly virtuous nor wholly wicked, and providing an agreeable
exercise for that natural piety which prompts us to mingle the
names of departed friends in our devotions, whether (as in
Africa) to pray to them, or (as in Europe) to pray for them.</p>

<p>From this brief review of the opinions of various races, it
will be evident that some conception of a spirit in man as distinguished
from his body prevails and always has prevailed
throughout the world. The special characteristic of this spiritual
essence has always been held to be its immateriality. All
religions conceive it as distinct from the body, most of them
evincing this view by treating it as capable of independent
existence. Many of them no doubt invest the spirit after death
with a material form, but this is the clothing of the idea, not
the idea itself. The form is received after the spirit has left its
terrestrial body, and does not originally belong to it; as in the
case of the serpents in South Africa, in which ancestral souls
are thought to dwell. This immaterial nature is clearly expressed—so
far as such an abstract idea can find clear expression
from a rude people—by those Kafirs who compare the
soul to a shadow. Nothing in the external world seems to have
so purely subjective a character as shadows; things which cannot
be felt or handled, and which appear to have no independent
substance.</p>

<p>Immateriality then is universally asserted (or attempted to
be asserted) of the soul. This is of the very essence of the
idea. No race believes that any portion of the body, or the
body as a whole, is the same thing as mind or spirit. But immortality
is not equally involved in the idea or inseparable from
it. Notably the Buddhistic creed—held by a considerable fraction
of mankind—teaches its votaries to look forward to utter
extinction as the <i>summum bonum</i>. True, the masses of average
believers may not dwell upon the hope of Nirvâna, but upon
that of heaven.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But the authorized dogma of the Church is,
that "not enjoyment and not sorrow is our destined end" or
goal, but the absolute rest, if so it may be called, of ceasing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688"> 688</span>
exist. And that this dogma was fervently accepted and thoroughly
believed in as a genuine "gospel," the early literature
of Buddhism amply proves. The Jews, a most religious people,
had no settled hope of immortality provided by their creed,
though the account of the creation of Adam shows how clearly
they distinguished mind from matter. Warburton indeed infers
the authenticity of the Hebrew Revelation from the very fact
of the absence of the doctrine of immortality; for no author
of a popular religion, except God himself, could have afforded
to dispense with so important an article. The more defective
Judaism was, the more clearly it was divine. Nor were the
classical nations of Greece and Rome at all more certain. With
them also opinions differed—some, like Plato and his followers,
asserting the immortality of the soul; others, like Epicurus and
his school, denying it. Cicero discusses it as an open question,
though himself holding to the belief in future existence. His
two possible alternatives are continued life in a condition of happiness,
or utter cessation of life; either of which he accepts
with equal calmness. The fear of hell did not torment him:
"post mortem quidem sensus aut optandus aut nullus est"
(Cato Major, xx. 74). Even if we are not to be immortal, as he
hopes, nevertheless it is a happy thing for man to be extinguished
at the fitting season (Ibid., xxiii. 86). Less philosophical
people, however, were troubled, like Christians, with the
notion of a future world of punishment; and Lucretius addresses
himself with all the ardor of a man proclaiming a
beneficent gospel to the dissipation of this popular delusion:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">"Nil igitur mors est, ad nos neque pertinet hilum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quandoquidem natura animi mortalis habetur."<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like other thinkers of his time, he distinguishes between the
<i>animus</i> and <i>anima</i>—spirit and soul, and this threefold division
of the nature of man subsisted for a time in the language and
ideas of Christians. But the essential point is that, whatever
further subdivisions may have been made, all schools, ancient
and modern, pagan and Christian, agreed in the fundamental
distinction between the spiritual principle and the material
instruments; between mind and matter, or soul and body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_689"> 689</span></p>

<p>Such, then, is the universal voice of the religious instinct.
Let us test the truth of this second postulate as we did that of
the first: by endeavoring to do without it. Then we have matter
and motion of matter; and the problem is:—Given these
elements to find the resultant, mind. Motion is merely change of
matter from place to place; therefore the question is, whether in
any kind of matter and any changes of matter we can discover
mind. Consider the material world statically. As known to
science (and we have no right to go beyond scientific observation
now), it contains certain properties perceptible to the
senses, such as color, sound, taste, and smell, roughness,
smoothness, and other tangible qualities, with extension and
resistance, discoverable by the muscular sense and touch combined.
Any further properties which a deeper analysis may disclose
will still belong to the domain of sensible perception, the
senses being the instruments employed in their discovery. In
which of these statical conditions of matter can mind be shown
to be involved? Or what combination of statical conditions
can produce mind as a part of the compound? Plainly any
attempt to discover it in matter at rest would be an absurdity.
Now consider the world dynamically. Here we have matter in
motion, matter as the recipient and the transmitter of certain
qualities of force. The mode of motion may be either molar
(that of masses through space), or molecular (that of particles
within a mass). In either case it is nothing but a change of
position relatively to other objects. Now, how can change of
position either be mind, or result in mind? Take the case of a
planet whirling through space. Does this molar motion, considered
in any conceivable light, bring us one step nearer to
mental phenomena? But all molar motion is of the same kind,
and however completely analyzed, can lead to nothing but matter
changing its position in space. Is molecular motion in better
case? When light is transmitted to the eye, the vibrations
of the atmosphere, which form the objective side of this phenomenon,
arriving at the optic nerve, cause corresponding vibrations
in it, and these transmitted to the brain result in certain
movements in its component particles. Which of all these
vibrations and movements is sensation? At what point does the
physical fact of changes in molecules of matter pass into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_690"> 690</span>
mental fact of changes in the quantity or quality of the light
perceived? Evidently no such point of transition can be found.
And not only can it not be found, but the bare hypothesis of
its existence is negatived by the fact that every physical movement
produces an exactly equivalent amount of physical movement;
so that there is nothing whatever in the resultant which
is not accounted for in the antecedents, and nothing in the antecedents
which has not its full effect in the resultant. There
is thus no room left for the passage of the objective fact of
molecular motion into the subjective fact of feeling.</p>

<p>Although these considerations practically exhaust the question,
yet another aspect of it may, for the sake of greater clearness,
be briefly touched upon. If the doctrine of abiogenesis be
accepted, it may be thought to afford some confirmation to the
materialistic hypothesis that mind is but a function or property
of matter. Do we not here see (it may be asked) life and sensation
arising out of non-sentient materials? And if a single
living creature can thus arise, then, by the doctrine of evolution,
all mind whatever is affiliated on matter. Such a conclusion,
however, would be quite unwarranted by the facts observed.
In abiogenesis unorganic matter is seen to pass into organic
matter, and this is the whole of the process known to science.
To assume that at some period in this process the material constituents
of the newly-formed creature acquire the property of
sensation is, to say the least, a very unscientific proceeding.
For, throughout all their permutations, the component elements
can (or could with improved instruments) be exactly observed,
measured, and weighed; enabling us to say that so and so
much, such and such of the inorganic elements has become so
and so much, such and such of the organic compound. Now
the factors of this compound do not (<i>ex hypothesi</i>) contain sensation.
How, then, did the compound acquire it? Where is
your warrant for suddenly introducing a consequent sensation—for
which you have no assignable antecedent?</p>

<p>Thus it is evident that between mind and matter, between
spirit and body, between internal and external phenomena,
there is a great gulf fixed, which no scientific or metaphysical
cunning can succeed in bridging over. Matter is never sensation,
and cannot be conceived as ever becoming sensation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691"> 691</span>
chain of material phenomena, with its several series of causes
and effects, is never broken; no physical cause is without its
adequate physical effect, nor is any physical effect without a
physical cause sufficient to produce it. The body is to the mind
an external, material phenomena; closely connected indeed
with mental states, and always more or less present to consciousness,
but no part of our true selves, no necessary element
in our conception of what we actually are. Every portion of
the bodily frame can be regarded by us as an outward object,
wholly independent of ourselves, and logically, if not practically,
separable from ourselves. Many portions, such as the
limbs, are actually so separable; and all of them are separable
in thought.</p>

<p>Still more impassable is this chasm in nature seen to be when
we remark, that there are two all-pervading elements in which
mind and matter have their being, and that the phenomena
within each element have definite relations to other phenomena
within the same element, but are incapable of being brought
into a like relation with those of the other element. These two
elements are Space and Time. Material particles are related to
one another in space, and in space alone. They are nearer to,
or more distant from, above or below, to the north, south, east,
or west of, the other material particles with which we compare
them. But they are not earlier or later than other particles.
The existence of concrete objects may be earlier or later than
that of other concrete objects; but when we talk of their existence
as earlier or later, we are talking of their relation to consciousness,
not of their relation to one another. It is the total
framed and classified by the mind that has a relation in time
to some other similar total; each total, analyzed into its ultimate
atoms, has only relations in space to the other total, likewise
analyzed into its ultimate atoms. Contrariwise, mental
objects, or states of consciousness, are related to one another
in time, and in time alone. States of consciousness can be compared
as earlier or later, simultaneous or successive. They have
no space-relations either to one another or to the material world.
It is common indeed to consider the mind as located in the
body, but this is incorrect. For absolutely nothing is meant by
saying that anything is in a given place except that it stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692"> 692</span>
in given space-relations to surrounding objects. My body is in
a place because it is <i>upon</i> the ground, <i>in</i> the air, <i>below</i> the
clouds, <i>amid</i> a certain environment which constitutes the country
and locality of that country which it is in. But my mind
has no surrounding objects of this nature at all. The thought,
say, of a distant friend can by no possibility be imagined as
enclosed within the grey matter of the brain, just to the right
of a nerve A, and in contact with a ganglion B. This thought,
and its accompanying emotion, could not be found by any vivisection
(if such were possible), though its correlative physical
condition might. Hence the mind is not in the body, but is an
independent entity whose phenomena, successive in time, run
parallel to but never intermingle with the phenomena of body,
extended in space.</p>

<p>From the view here stated of the irremoveable distinction
between mind and matter an important corollary will be seen
to follow.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> No physical movement (it has been shown) can be
conceived as passing into a state of consciousness, for each
physical movement begets further physical movement, and
while it is fully spent in its physical consequent is itself fully
accounted for by its physical antecedent. The converse of this
doctrine must therefore be equally true. That is to say, no
state of consciousness can pass into a physical movement, for,
if it could, this movement would have another than a physical
antecedent. In other words, the mind can in no way influence
the actions of the body. It cannot stand in a casual relation
to any physical fact whatever. Hence the doctrine of the will
(not only of free will but of any will) falls to the ground. For
the current conception of a will supposes that a chain of material
events passes at some point in its course into a state of
consciousness, and that this state of consciousness again originates
a chain of material events. Say that I hear some one call
my name, and go to the window to ascertain who it is. Then
the common explanation would be, not only that the atmo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693"> 693</span>spheric
undulations, which are the material correlative of sound
passing into the brain by the auditory nerves, produced the
sensation of hearing, which is true, but that this sensation in
its turn produced those exertions of the limbs which result in
my arrival at the window, which is erroneous. According to
the view here adopted, the atmospheric undulations stand in a
direct relation of causation to the affection of the auditory
nerve, and this affection, in a direct relation of causation, to
the resulting movements. The states of consciousness in like
manner stand in a direct relation of simple sequence to each
other; the sensation of sitting in a room being followed by that
of hearing my name, this by the thought that there is some one
outside calling me, this by the sensation of motion through
space, and this last by that of seeing the person from whom
the call emanated standing in the expected place. But at no
point can the one train of events be converted into the other.
And while the train of external sequences does influence the
train of internal sequences, this latter has no corresponding influence
upon the former. For this would imply that at some
period in the succession physical movements lost themselves in
consciousness; ceased to <i>be</i> physical movements, and became
something of an alien nature. It would imply further that
such movements originated <i>de novo</i> from something of an alien
nature having no calculable or measurable relation to them.
Either of which implications would constitute an exception to
the Persistence of Force.</p>

<p>Man is, in short, as the adherents of this opinion have called
him, a "conscious automaton." He does not will his own
actions, nor do external manifestations, whether those of the
unconscious or the conscious orders of existence, influence his
will. But along with the set of objective facts there is always
present a parallel set of subjective facts, and the subjective
facts stand in an invariable relation to the objective facts. So
that where the material circumstances, both those of the surrounding
world and those of the body, are of a given character,
the non-material circumstances, the state of mind, is also of a
given and precisely corresponding character. Variations in the
one imply variations in the other; feelings in the one change or
remain fixed with changes or fixity in the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_694"> 694</span></p>

<p>Could the friends of dogmatic religion know the things
belonging to their peace, they would bestow upon this doctrine
their most earnest support; for it deals the death-blow to that
semi-scientific materialism which derives a certain countenance
from the discoveries of the day, and which is—second to religious
dogmas themselves—the most dangerous enemy of the
spiritual conception of the universe and of mankind. Not that
in lifting a voice against materialistic views, I mean for a
moment to lend a helping hand to the vulgar and irreverent
outcry which is so often raised against matter itself as something
gross and degraded, and deserving only of a contemptuous
tolerance at our hands. I should have thought that the
endless beauty of the material universe, and the varied enjoyments
to be derived from its contemplation, as also the profound
instruction to be obtained by its study, would have sufficed to
give it a higher place in the estimation of religious minds.
With such opposition to materialism as this I can have no vestige
of sympathy. The form of materialism which I contend
against, not as irreligious but as unphilosophic, is that which
confounds the two orders of phenomena—physical and mental—under
one idea, that of matter. Matter is supposed in this philosophy
to be the parent of mind. A bridge is sought to be
thrown across the great gulf which is fixed between us and the
world without. But the moment we seek to walk over this
imaginary bridge it crashes beneath our feet, and we are hurled
into the abyss below.</p>

<p>Between that which feels, thinks, perceives, and reasons on
the one hand, and that which is felt, thought about, perceived,
and reasoned on, there is no community of nature. The distinction
between these two, though it need not be ultimate in
the order of things, is absolutely ultimate in the order of
thought. In their own undiscoverable nature these two manifestations
may be one; in their relation to us they are for ever
two.</p>

<small>THE RELATION OF THE OBJECTIVE TO THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT.</small></h3></div>


<p>One final postulate has been found to be involved in all religion,
namely, that between the human essence spoken of as the
subjective element, and the power spoken of as the objective
element, "there is held to be a singular correspondence, their
relationship finding its concrete expression in religious worship
on the one side and theological dogma on the other." Ritual,
consecration of things and places, ordination of priests, omens,
inspiration of prophets and of books, all of them imply the supposed
possibility of such a relation. All of them, however, from
their contradictory and variable character, prove that they are
but imperfect efforts to find utterance for the emotion which
underlies them all. But that this emotion is incapable of an
explanation consistent with rational belief is not therefore to be
taken for granted.</p>

<p>Consider, first, that in order to be aware of the existence of
the ultimate and unknown power, we must possess some faculty
in our constitution by which that power is felt. It must, so to
speak, come in contact with us at some point in our nature.</p>

<p>Now, no sensible perception can lead us to this conception as
a generalization. The whole universe, regarded merely as a
series of presentations to the senses, contains not a single object
which can possibly suggest it. Nor can any combination of such
presentations be shown to include within them any such idea.
Neither can the existence of such a power be inferred by the
exercise of the reasoning faculty. There is no analogical case
from which the inference can be drawn. When we reason we
proceed from something known to something unknown, and conclude
that the latter, resembling the former in one or more of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696"> 696</span>
its qualities, will resemble it also in the quality yet to be established.
In exploring, for instance, some deserted spot, we find
traces of a building. Now, previous experience has taught us
that such buildings are only found where human builders have
made them. We conclude, therefore, that we have stumbled
upon a work of human hands. Suppose we explore further and
find the remains of the building very extensive. We now draw
the further inference that it was inhabited by a wealthy man,
because we know that only the wealthy can afford to live in
magnificent houses. But if prolonged excavation lead to the
discovery of long rows of buildings, of various sizes and having
streets between them, we confidently assert that we have
unearthed a ruined city; for we are aware that no single man,
however rich or powerful, is likely to have built so much. Of
these three inferences, the first only is, strictly speaking, infallibly
true. But the others are rendered by familiar analogies so
highly probable as to be practically certain. Now let the thing
sought be, not some single cause of a single phenomenon, or
the various causes of various phenomena, but the ultimate
cause of all phenomena whatever,—where is the corresponding
case on which we can proceed to argue? Plainly there is none.
There is no <i>other</i> world or system to which we can appeal and
say, "Those stars and those planets were made by a God,
therefore our own sun and its planets must have been made by
a God also." Every single argument we can frame to establish
the existence of deity assumes in its major premiss the very
thing to be proved. It takes for granted that phenomenal
objects require a cause, and were not the idea of this necessity
already in the mind it could not take one single step. For if it
be contended, say, that the world could not exist without a
Creator, we have but to ask, "Why not?" and our adversary
can proceed no further with his argument. All he can ever do
is to appeal to a sentiment in us corresponding to the sentiment
of which he himself is conscious.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that neither direct observation, nor reasoning,
which is generalized observation, supplies the material for
an induction as to the existence of an Unknowable Cause. Yet
this idea is so persistent in the human race as to resist every
effort to do without it. In one form or another it invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_697"> 697</span>
creeps in. There is but one possible explanation of such a fact:
namely, that it is one of those primary constituents of our
nature which are incapable of proof because they are themselves
the foundations on which proof must be erected. We
cannot demonstrate a single law of nature without supposing a
world external to ourselves. And we cannot suppose a world
external to ourselves without referring explicitly or implicitly
to an unknown entity manifested in that world. The faculty
by which this truth is known must be considered as a
kind of internal sense. It is a direct perception. And precisely
as objects of direct perception by the senses appear widely dissimilar
at different distances, to different men, and to the same
man at different times, so the object of the religious emotion is
variously conceived in different places and ages, by different
men, and by the same man at different times. Moreover, as the
religious sentiment in the mind of man perceives its object, the
Ultimate Being, so that Being is conceived as making itself
known to the mind of man through the religious sentiment. A
reciprocal relation is thus established; the Unknowable causing
a peculiar intuition, the mind of man receiving it. And this is the
grain of fact at the foundation of the numerous statements of
religious men, that they have felt themselves inspired by God,
that he speaks to them and speaks through them, that they enter
into communion with him in prayer, and obey his influence
during their lives. We need not discard such feelings as idle
delusions. In form they are fanciful and erroneous; in substance
they are genuine and true. And in a higher sense the
adherent of the universal religion may himself admit their
title to a place in his nature. To use the words of a great philosopher,
"he, like every other man, may consider himself as
one of the myriad agencies through whom works the Unknown
Cause;" "he too may feel that when the Unknown Cause produces
in him a certain belief, he is thereby authorized to profess
and act out that belief" (Spencer's "First Principles," 2d
ed., § 34, p. 123).</p>

<p>But we may go still deeper in our examination of the nature
of the relation between the Ultimate Being and the mind of
man. To do so we must briefly recur to the philosophical questions
touched upon in the eighth chapter of this Book. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698"> 698</span>
there discussed four possible modes of viewing the great problem
presented by the existence of sensible objects: Common
and Metaphysical Realism, Moderate and Complete Idealism.
Let us briefly reconsider these several systems to discover
whether any of them affords a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>Common Realism is excluded by the consideration that it
treats the qualities of external objects as existing in those
objects and not in the percipient subject. It requires but little
reflection to prove that such qualities are modes of consciousness,
not modes of absolute being. This defect is surmounted
in Metaphysical Realism, which, however, is liable to the fatal
objection, that it takes for granted an abstract substance in
material things, which substance is like the Unknowable, utterly
inconceivable, yet is not the Unknowable, and is incapable of
accounting for any of the manifestations belonging to the mental
order. So that we should have a superfluous entity brought
in to form the substance of matter, of which entity neither our
senses, nor our reason, nor our emotions, give us any information.
For matter, in the abstract, is not the matter perceived
by the senses; nor is it the object of the religious sentiment;
nor is its existence capable of any kind of proof save that
which consists in establishing the necessity of some kind of
Permanent Reality below phenomena. And this Reality is not
only the substratum of material, but of all phenomena whatsoever.
Moderate Idealism is in no better case. For in denying
all true existence except to living creatures it fails utterly to
give any rational account of that order of events which is universally
and instinctively referred to external causes, nor can it
find any possible origin for the living creatures in whose reality
it believes. Extreme Idealism recognizes no problem to be
dealt with, and can therefore offer no solution.</p>

<p>Each of these systems, however, while false as a whole, contains
a partial truth. Extreme Idealism is the outcome of the
ordinary, unreflecting Realism; for if the Common Realist be
convinced that appearances do not imply existence, and if he
believe in no existence but appearances, the ground is cut from
under his feet, and he remains standing upon nothing. He
knows only phenomena, and the phenomena are mere ideas of
his own mind. The truth common to these two extremes is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699"> 699</span>
that so emphatically asserted by Berkeley, that the <i>esse</i> of
material objects is <i>percipi</i>; that we exhaust the physical phenomenon
when we describe its apparent qualities, and need not
introduce besides these a material substance to which those
qualities are related as its accidents. They are not the accidents,
but the actual thing, in so far as it is material. Metaphysical
Realism and moderate Idealism are united in the
recognition of the truth that the phenomena are not the ultimate
realities, and that the qualities of bodies, when analyzed,
are subjective, not objective; forms of the human mind, and
not independent, external existences.</p>

<p>Hence these various philosophies, like the various religions
of which they are in some sort metaphysical parallels, must be
considered as preparing the way for the admission of that all-embracing
truth which is the common ground of metaphysics
and religion.</p>

<p>Examine a simple objective phenomenon. Then you find
that you can separate it into all its component qualities: its
color, taste, smell, extension, and so forth; and that after all
these qualities have been taken into account nothing of the
object remains save the vague feeling of an unknown cause by
which the whole phenomenon is produced. All the apparent
qualities, without exception, are resolvable into modes of consciousness,
but the whole object is not so resolvable. For the
question still remains, How did we come to have those modes
of consciousness? Thus the analysis of the commonest material
object leads us straight to an unknowable origin of known
manifestations. And each particular phenomenon brings us to
the same result. But are we to assume a special Unknowable
for each special object? A little consideration will show that
the division and subdivision we make of the objects of sensible
perception resembles their apparent qualities in being purely
subjective, and indeed more than subjective, arbitrary. For I
consider an object as one or many, according to the point of
view from which I regard it. The glass which I hold in my
hand is at this moment one; but the next moment it is shivered
into a thousand atoms, and each of these atoms is of complex
character, and resolvable into still simpler parts. The planet
we inhabit is, for the astronomer, one object; for the geologist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700"> 700</span>
a number of distinct rocks; for the botanist it is composed of
mineral and vegetable constituents, and of these, the latter,
which alone engage his attention, are numerous and various;
for the chemist it consists of an infinite multitude of elementary
atoms variously combined. Hence unity and multiplicity
are mere modes of subjective reflection; not ultimate modes of
objective being. And the Unknowable cannot, strictly speaking,
be regarded as either one or many, since each alike implies limitation
and separation from something else. Rather is it all-comprehending;
the Universal Foundation upon which unity
and multiplicity alike are built.</p>

<p>Material things, then, are analyzable into modes of consciousness
with an unknown cause to which these modes are due.
But what is consciousness itself? Like matter, it has its subjective
and its objective aspect. The subjective aspect consists
of its various phenomenal conditions; the sensations which we
ascribe to outward objects as their producing causes, and the
emotions, passions, thoughts, and feelings which we conceive as
of internal origin. The objective aspect consists of the unknown
essence itself which experiences these various states; of the very
self which is supposed to persist through all its changes of
form; of the actual being which is the ultimate Reality of our
mental lives. The existence of this ultimate Ego is known as
an immediate fact of consciousness, and cannot be called in
question without impugning the direct assurance which every
one feels of his own being as apart from his particular and
transient feelings. Nobody believes that he is the several sensations
and emotions which he experiences in life; he believes
that he <i>has</i> them. And if the existence of the Unknowable
underlying material manifestations is perceived by a direct,
indubitable inference, the existence of the Unknowable underlying
mental manifestations is perceived without an inference at
all by an intuition from which there is no appeal. For no one
can even attempt to reason with me about this conviction without
resting his argument upon facts, and inferences from facts,
which are in themselves less certain than this primary certainty
which he is seeking to overthrow.</p>

<p>Existence, then, is known to us immediately in our own case;
mediately in every other—consequently, the only conception we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_701"> 701</span>
can frame of existence is derived from ourselves. Hence when
we say that anything exists, we can only mean one of two
things: either that it exists as a mode of human consciousness,
as in the case of material things; or that it exists <i>per se</i>, and
is the very substance of consciousness itself. And the former of
these modes of existence is altogether dependent upon a conscious
subject. A material object is a congeries of material
qualities, none of which can be conceived at all except in relation
to some percipient subject. Take away the subject, and
color, extension, solidity, sound, smell, and every other quality,
vanish into nothing. The existence of these qualities, and
hence the existence of matter itself in its phenomenal character,
is relative and secondary. There remains therefore only the
second of these two modes of existence as absolute and primary.
The substance of consciousness, then, is the one reality which is
known to exist; and in no other form is existence in its purity
conceivable by us. For if we attempt to conceive a something
as existent which is neither object nor subject, neither that
which is felt nor that which feels, neither that which is thought
nor that which thinks, we must inevitably fail. There is no
<i>tertium quid</i> which is neither mind nor matter of which we can
frame the most remote conception. We may, if we please, imagine
the existence of such a <i>tertium quid</i>, but the hypothesis
is altogether fanciful, and would have nothing in science, nothing
in the construction of the human mind, to render it even
plausible. Indeed, it would be making an illegitimate use of the
word "existence" to apply it in such a sense. Existence to us
<i>means</i> consciousness, and never can mean anything else. We
cannot by any effort conceive a universe previous to the origin
of life in which there was no consciousness; for the moment we
attempt to conceive it, we import our own consciousness into it.
We think of ourselves as seeing or feeling it. The effort, therefore,
to frame an idea of any existing thing without including
consciousness in the idea is self-defeating, and when we predicate
Existence of the Unknown Cause, we predicate its kinship
to that ultimate substance of the mind from which alone our
conception of absolute existence is derived.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a second and more intimate relationship
between the objective and the subjective elements in the relig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702"> 702</span>ious
emotion. They are found to be of kindred nature; or, to
speak with stricter caution, it is found that we cannot think of
them but as thus akin to one another. We must ever bear in
mind, however, that our thoughts upon such a subject as this
can be no more than partial approximations to the truth; tentative
explorations in a dark region of the mind rather than
accurate measurements of the ground. Thus, in the present
instance, we have spoken of the Unknowable as more or less
akin to the mind of man; yet we cannot think of the Unknowable
as resembling the fleeting states which are all that we
know by direct observation of the constitution of the mind. It
is not the passing and variable modes, but the fixed and
unchangeable substratum on which these modes are conceived
to be impressed, which the Unknowable must be held to resemble.
And this substratum itself is an absolute mystery. We can
in no way picture it to ourselves without its modes, which nevertheless
we cannot regard as appertaining to its ultimate being.
One further consideration will establish a yet closer relationship
than that of likeness. The Unknown Reality, which is the
source of all phenomena whatsoever, mental and physical, must
of necessity <i>include</i> within itself that mode of existence which is
manifested in consciousness; for otherwise, we must imagine
yet another power as the originator of conscious life, and we
should then have two unknown entities, still requiring a higher
entity behind them both, to effect that entire harmony which
actually subsists between them. The Unknowable is, therefore,
the hidden source from which both the great streams of being,
internal and external, take their rise. Since, then, our minds
themselves originate in that Universal Source, since it comprehends
every form of existence within itself, we stand to it in the
relation of parts to a whole, in which and by which those parts
subsist. There is thus not only likeness but identity of nature
between ourselves and our unknown Origin. And it is literally
true that in it "we live, and move, and have our being."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the summit to which we have at length attained, we
may survey the ground we have already traversed, and comprehend,
now that they lie below us, a few of the intricacies
which we met with on our way. The apparent puzzle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703"> 703</span>
automatism, for example, may be resolved into a more comprehensive
law. It was shown, at the conclusion of the preceding
chapter, that a train of physical events could in no way impinge
upon, or pass over into, a train of mental events, nor a state of
consciousness be converted into physical movements. But it
was hinted that, while the distinction between the two great
series of manifestations, those of mind and those of matter,
was ultimate in the order of thought, it need not be ultimate
in the order of things. Of this suggested possibility we have
now found the confirmation; for we have seen that material
phenomena, analyzed to their lowest terms, resolve themselves
into forms of consciousness, and forms of consciousness, analyzed
in their turn, prove to be the varied modes of an unknown
subject; and this unknown subject has its roots in the
ultimate Being in which both these great divisions of the phenomenal
universe find their foundation and their origin. The
distinction, therefore, between the mental and the material
train belongs to these trains in their character of phenomena
alone. They are distinguished in the human mind, not in the
order of nature. Thus, if we recur to the illustration used in
explaining automatism, we pointed out that in the circumstance
of hearing a call and going to the window, two series might
be thus distinguished: 1. The material series, consisting of
atmospheric undulations, affections of the nerves and matter of
the brain, movements of the body; 2. The mental series, consisting
of the sensations of sitting still, and hearing of the
thought of a person, of the sensations of motion, and seeing
the person. Now, if we take the trouble to observe the terms
of which the first series is composed, we shall see that they
also express states of consciousness, though states of a different
kind from those contained in the terms of the second series.
Undulations, nervous affections, movements, and so forth, are
only intelligible by us as modifications of our consciousness.
To conceive in any degree the atmospheric perturbations which
are the physical correlatives of sound, we must imagine them
as somehow felt or perceived—for instance, as a faint breeze.
To conceive the cerebral changes implied in hearing, we must
imagine ourselves as dissecting and examining the interior of
the brain. In other words, the external train of events to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704"> 704</span>
consciousness runs over parallel can only be represented in
thought by translating it into terms of consciousness; and the
absolute harmony of both these trains, the fact that while
states of consciousness do not originate the movements of our
bodies, they yet bear so unvarying a relation to them as to be
mistaken for their causes, finds its solution in the reflection
that, when we look below the appearances to the reality pervading
both, it is the same Universal Being which is manifested
in each alike.</p>

<p>Hence, too, the sense of independent power to produce physical
effects in accordance with mental conceptions, which forms
the great obstacle to the general admission of the doctrine of
human automatism. Reason as we may, we still feel that we
are reservoirs of force which we give out in the shape of material
movement whenever we please and as we please. And if
the doctrine of the Persistence of Force appears, by showing
that every physical consequent has a purely physical antecedent,
to contradict this feeling, we naturally give the preference
to the feeling over the doctrine. But since the Persistence of
Force is itself no less firmly seated in consciousness than the
sense of independent power—since all nature would be a chaos
without the Persistence of Force—it is the part of true philosophy
to give its due to each. And this may be done by admitting
the particle of truth contained in the belief that the human
will influences the external world. We are indeed reservoirs of
force. But it is not our own peculiar force that is exerted
through us; it is the Universal Force, which is evinced no less
in the actions of men than in the movements of inanimate
nature. And since those actions are in constant unison with
their wishes, there is not, and cannot be, the sense of constraint
which is usually opposed to voluntary performance. Thus, to
take a simple illustration, the necessities of our physical constitution
absolutely compel us to support ourselves by food; yet
no man feels that in eating his meals he is acting under external
compulsion.</p>

<p>It would be a strange except ion indeed to the universal prevalence
of unvarying law, if human beings were permitted to
exert independent influence upon the order of events. Not in
so slovenly a manner has the work of nature been performed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705"> 705</span>
We are no more free to disturb the harmony and beauty of
the universe than are the stars in their courses or the planets
in their orbits. Our courses and orbits are no less fixed than
theirs, and it is but the imperfection of our knowledge, if they
have not been, and cannot yet be discovered. But it would be
a lamentable blot upon a universe, where all things are fixed
by a Power "in whom there is no variableness nor shadow of
turning," were there permitted to exist a race of creatures who
were a law unto themselves.</p>

<p>Again, the relation now established between the human mind
and the ultimate Source both of mind and matter, serves to
throw light upon that dark spot in the hypothesis of evolution—the
origin of consciousness. For while in this hypothesis
there is a continual progression, of which each step is the natural
consequence of another, from the gaseous to the solid condition
of our system, from inorganic to organic substances, from
the humblest organization to the most complex, there is absolutely
no traceable gradation from the absence to the presence
of conscious life. No cunning contrivance of science can derive
sensation from non-sentient materials, for the difference between
the two is not a difference in degree of development, but in
kind. There is a radical unlikeness between the two, and it is
unphilosophic, as well as unscientific, to disguise the fact that
a mere process of material evolution can never lead from the
one to the other. "The moment of arising of consciousness,"
says Mr. Shadworth Hodgson, "is the most important break in
the world of phenomena or nature taken as a whole; the phenomena
above and the phenomena below it can never be reduced
completely into each other; there is a certain heterogeneity
between them. But this is not the only instance of such a
heterogeneity" (Hodgson's "Theory of Practice," vol. i. p. 340).
I venture to say that it is the only instance, and that there is
nothing else in nature which can properly be compared with it.
The instances of similar heterogeneity which Mr. Hodgson gives
appear to me less carefully considered than might have been
expected from so careful a writer. That between Time and
Space, which is his first case, is involved in that between mind
and matter, and is only another expression of it (see <i>supra</i>, p.
447); while "curves and straight lines," and "physical and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706"> 706</span>
vital forces," are not truly heterogeneous at all, unless under
"vital forces" we include mental effort, and so again illustrate
the primary unlikeness by a case included under it. But the
last example is remarkable. "Until Mr. Darwin propounded
his law of natural selection, it was supposed also [that there
was heterogeneity] between species of living organisms in physiology."
Now it is the great triumph of the evolutional system
to have rid us of this unintelligible break, and to have shown
that the whole of the material universe, inorganic and organic,
is the result of the unchangeable operation of laws which are
no less active now than they have ever been. In other words,
evolution dispenses with the necessity of supposing the existence,
at some point in the history of the planet, of a special
law for the production of species brought into operation <i>ad
hoc</i>.</p>

<p>But the general principles which apply to the origin of
organic products must apply also to the origin of conscious life.
This also must be figured as an evolution. This also must take
place without the aid of a special law brought into operation
<i>ad hoc</i>. Like the evolution of material products, it can only be
conceived as taking place from a preëxisting fund, containing
potentially the whole of the effects which are afterwards found
in actual existence.</p>

<p>Let us test this by trying to conceive the process in other
ways. Consciousness might be supposed to arise in two ways:
by special creation, and by uncaused origin, from nothing. Both
possibilities are in absolute contradiction to the fundamental
principles of evolution. Creation by a superior power is a
hypothesis standing on a level with that of the creation of man
out of the dust of the earth. To realize it in thought at all we
must suppose the very thing intended to be denied, namely,
the material of mind already existing in the universe, as that
of body existed—in the earth. Otherwise, we should be obliged
to admit the unthinkable hypothesis of the origin of something
from nothing. This latter difficulty presses with its full force
upon the second supposition. Mind would thereby be represented
as suddenly springing into being without any imaginable
antecedent. For no material antecedent can produce it without
an exception to the Persistence of Force, which requires a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707"> 707</span>
material consequent. And it cannot arise without any antecedent
but by a similar exception.</p>

<p>Neither creation nor destruction can in fact be represented
as occurring in nature. We cannot conceive a new being arising
out of nothing, or passing into nothing. As the development
of the physical universe takes place by the change, composition,
decomposition, and re-composition of preëxisting constituents,
so it must be with the development of mind. We cannot suppose
the origin of sensation, its advance to more varied and
complex kinds, through emotions, passions, and reasonings to
the most subtle feelings and the profoundest thoughts, without
believing that all of these have their source in the Ultimate
Reality of nature, which comprehends not these only, but every
further perfection of which we may yet be capable in ages to
come.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the solution of the difficulty which was shown
(p. 690) to beset the theory of abiogenesis; a theory which, if
ultimately accepted by science, as I believe it will be, will for
the first time bring perfect unity into our conceptions of the
development of the world we live in. While science will thus
show that there is no impassable break between inorganic and
organic forms of matter, philosophy will confirm it by showing,
that there is no real distinction between the universal life which
is manifested in the (so-called) inanimate forces and constituents
of our system and the fragmentary life which comes to
light in animated creatures. There is heterogeneity nowhere.
There are no breaks in nature. There are no unimaginable
leaps in her unbroken course.</p>

<p>From the point of view now reached we can understand also—so
far as understanding is possible in such a case—the
apparent riddle of our knowledge of the existence of the Unknowable.
We can explain the universal sentiment of religious
minds that there is some direct relation between them and the
object of their worship. The sense of an intuitional perception
of that object, the sense of undefinable similarity thereto, the
sense of inspiration and of guidance thereby, are included under
and rendered intelligible by the actual identity in their ultimate
natures of the subject and the object of religious feeling. And
the incomprehensibility of the latter is shown to have an obvi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708"> 708</span>ous
reason. For the part cannot comprehend the whole of
which it is a part. It can but feel that there is a whole, in
some mysterious way related to itself. But what that whole is,
the conditions of its existence render it impossible that it should
even guess.</p>

<p>Imagine the whole of the atmosphere divided into two great
currents: a hot current continually ascending, and a cold current
continually descending. And let the hot current represent
the stream of conscious life, the cold current the stream of
material things. To complete the simile, conceive that there is
a sharp boundary between the two currents, so that atoms of
air can never cross to and fro; while yet the conscious atoms
in the hot current are aware of the existence of the unconscious
atoms in the cold one. Now if the atoms or particles in the
conscious current should be gifted with senses in proportion to
their size, they will see and feel an infinitely minute portion
both of the ascending current in which they they themselves are
placed, and of the descending current they are passing by. But
of the whole of the atmosphere of which they are themselves
fragmentary portions they will be able to form no conception
whatever. Its existence they will be aware of, for it will be
needed to explain their own. But of its nature they will have
no idea, except that in some undefinable way it is like themselves.
Nor will they be able to form any picture of the cause
which is continually carrying them upwards, and forcing their
homologues in the opposite current downwards. While, if we
suppose these opposite movements to represent the elements of
Time and Space, they will be conscious of themselves only in
terms of movement upwards, and of the unconscious particles
in terms of movement downwards. They will suppose these two
movements to be of the very essence of hot and cold particles,
and will be able to conceive them only under these terms.
Suppose, lastly, that at a certain point in their progress the
hot particles become cold and pass into the opposing current,
losing their individual, particular life, then their fellow-particles
in the hot current will lose sight of them at that point,
and they will be merged in the general stream of being to
emerge again in their turn into the stream of conscious being.</p>

<p>Imperfect as this simile is, and as all such similes must be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709"> 709</span>
it serves in some faint measure to express the relation of the
mind of man to its mysterious Source. And it serves also to
illustrate the leading characteristics of Religion and Theology,
or Faith and Belief, the function of the first having ever been
to conceive the existence of that relation, and the function of
the second to misconceive its character. Thus there runs
through the whole course of religious history a pervading error
and a general truth. In all its special manifestations these two
have been mingled confusedly together, and the manifold forms
of error have generally obscured from sight the single form of
truth.</p>

<p>The relation held by Faith to Belief, by the true elements to
the false, in special creeds, may be thus expressed: That the
creeds have sought to individualize, and thus to limit that which
is essentially general and unlimited. Thus worship, in its purest
character a mere communing of the mind with its unknown
Source, has been narrowed to the presentation of petitions to a
personal deity. Particular places and peculiar objects have
been selected as evincing, in some exceptional manner, the presence
of the infinite Being which pervades all places and things
alike. Certain men have been regarded as the exclusive organs
of the ultimate Truth; certain books, as its authorized expressions;
whereas the several races of men in their different modes
of life, and in the diverse products of their art and their culture,
are all in their variety, and even in their conflict, inspired
workers in the hands of that Truth which is manifested completely
in none, partially in all.</p>

<p>And as it has been with the special objects upon which Theology
has fixed its gaze, so it has been with the general object
which underlies them all. This, too, has been individualized, limited
and defined. It has been forgotten that we are but forms of
that which we are seeking to bring within the grasp of our reason,
and cannot therefore see around it, above it, and below it.
But this truth, which Theology is ever forgetting, Religion must
ever proclaim. The proclamation of this truth is the title-deed
of its acceptance by mankind. Without this, it would sink into
the dishonored subject of incessant wranglings and profitless
dispute. When it begins to define the Infinite, it ceases, in the
purer sense of the word, to be Religion, and can only command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710"> 710</span>
the assent of reasonable beings in so far as its assertions comply
with the rigorous methods of logical demonstration. But
this condition is in fact impossible of fulfillment, for the nature
of the object concerning which we reason, renders the exact
terms of logical propositions misleading and inadequate. The
Unknowable Reality does not admit of definition, comprehension,
or description. How should we, mere fragments of that
Reality, define, comprehend, or describe the Infinite Being
wherein we have taken our rise, and whereto we must return?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus is Religion analyzed, explained and justified. Its varied
forms have been shown to be unessential and temporary; its
uniform substance to be essential and permanent. Belief has
melted away under the comparative method; Faith has remained
behind. From two sides, however, objections may be raised to
the results of this analysis. Those who admit no ultimate residuum
of truth in the religious sentiment at all, may hold that
I have done it too much honor in conceding so much; while
those who adhere to some more positive theology than is
admitted here, will think that I have left scarcely anything
worth the having in conceding so little.</p>

<p>To the first class of objectors I may perhaps be permitted to
point out the extreme improbability of the presence in human
nature of a universally-felt emotion without a corresponding
object. Even if they themselves do not realize in their own
minds the force of that emotion they will at least not deny its
historical manifestations. They will scarcely question that it
has been in all ages known to history as an inspiring force, and
often an overmastering passion. They will believe the evidence
of those who affirm that they are conscious of that emotion
now, and cannot attribute it to anything but the kind of Cause
which religion postulates. The actual presence of the emotion
they will not deny, though the explanation attempted of its
origin they will. But those who make the rather startling
assertion that a deep-seated and wide-spread emotion is absolutely
without any object resembling that which it imagines to
be its source, are bound to give some tenable account of the
genesis of that emotion. How did it come into being at all?
How having come into being, did it continue and extend? How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711"> 711</span>
did it come to mistake a subjective illusion for an objective
reality?</p>

<p>These are questions pressing for an answer from those who
ask us to believe that one of our strongest feelings exists merely
to deceive. But it will be found, I believe, that all explanations
tending to show that this emotion is illusory in its nature
assume the very unreality they seek to prove. Should it, for
example, be contended that human beings, conscious of a force
in their own bodies, extend the conception of this force to a
superhuman being, which extension is illegitimate, it is assumed,
not proved, in such an argument as this, that the force manifested
in the universe at large is not in some way akin to that manifested
in human beings. Again, should it be urged that man,
being aware of design in his own works, fancies a like design
in the works of nature, it is a mere assumption that this attribution
of the ideas of his own mind to a mind greater than his
is an unwarrantable process. The argument from design may
be, and in my opinion is, open to other grave objections; but
its mere presence cannot be used as explaining the manner in
which the religious emotion has come to exist. Rather is it the
religious emotion which has found expression in the argument
from design. The same criticism applies to all accounts of this
sentiment which aim at finding an origin for it sufficient to
explain its presence without admitting its truth. They all of
them assume the very point at issue.</p>

<p>But the real difficulty that is felt about religion lies deeper
than in the mere belief that a given emotion may be deceptive.
It lies in the doubt whether a mere emotion can be taken in
evidence of the presence in nature of any object at all. Emotions
are by their very nature vague, and this is of all perhaps the
vaguest. Nor are emotions vague only; they are inexpressible
in precise language, and even when we express them as clearly
as we can, they remain unintelligible to those who have not
felt them. Now this general and unspecific character of emotions
renders it hard for those who are wanting in any given
emotion to understand its intensity in others, and even fully to
believe in their statements about it. Were religion a case of
sensible perception they would have no such doubt. Color-blind
persons do not question the faculty of distinguishing colors in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712"> 712</span>
others. But while the sharp definitions of these senses compel
us to believe in the existence of their objects, the comparatively
hazy outlines drawn by the emotions leave us at least a
physical possibility of disputing the existence of theirs.</p>

<p>Yet the cases are in their natures identical. We see a table,
and because we see it we infer the existence of a real thing
external to ourselves. The presence of the sensations is conceived
to be an adequate warrant for asserting the presence of
their cause. Precisely in the same way, we feel the Unknowable
Being, and because we feel it we infer the existence of a
real object both external to ourselves and within ourselves.
The presence of the emotion is conceived to be an adequate
warrant for asserting the presence of its cause. Undoubtedly,
the supposed object of the sensations and the supposed object
of the emotion <i>might</i> be both of them illusory. This is conceivable
in logic, though not in fact. But there can be no
reason for maintaining the unreality of the emotional, and the
reality of the sensible object. Existence is believed in both
instances on the strength of an immediate, intuitional inference.
The mental processes are exactly parallel. And if it be
contended that sensible perception carries with it a stronger
warrant for our belief in the existence of its objects than internal
feeling, the reasons for this contention must be exhibited
before we can be asked to accept it; otherwise, it will again
turn out to be a pure assumption, constituting, not a reason for
the rejection of religion by those who now accept it, but a
mere explanation of the conduct of those who do not.</p>

<p>In fact, however, the denial of the truth of religion is no
less emotional than its affirmation. It is not denied because
those who disbelieve in it have anything to produce against it,
but because the inner sense which results in religion is either
absent in them, or too faint to produce its usual consequences.
For this of course they are not to blame, and nothing can be
more irrational than to charge them with moral delinquency or
culpable blindness. If the Unknown Cause is not perceptible
to them, that surely is not a deficiency to be laid to their
charge. But when they quit the emotional stronghold wherein
they are safe to speak of those to whom that Unknown Cause
is perceptible as the victims of delusion, these latter may con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713"> 713</span>fidently
meet them on the field which they themselves have
chosen.</p>

<p>First, then, it is at least a rather startling supposition that
their fellow creatures have always been, and are still, the victims
of a universal delusion, from which they alone enjoy the
privilege of exemption. Presumption, at all events, is against
a man who asserts that everybody but himself sees wrongly.
He may be the only person whose eyes have not deceived him,
but we should require him to give the strongest proof of so
extraordinary an assertion. And in all cases which are in the
least degree similar, this condition is complied with without
the smallest hesitation. There are, so far as I am aware, no
instances of proved universal delusions, save those arising from
the misleading suggestions of the senses. That the earth is a
flat surface, that the sun moves round it, that the sun and
moon are larger than the stars, that the blue sky begins at a
fixed place, are inferences which the uninstructed observer cannot
fail to draw from the most obvious appearances. But those
who have combated these errors have not done so by merely
telling the world at large that it was mistaken; they have
pointed out the phenomena from which the erroneous inferences
were drawn, and have shown at the same time that other
phenomena, no less evident to the senses than these, were
inconsistent with the explanation given. They have then substituted
an explanation which accounted for all the phenomena
alike, both the more obvious phenomena and the less so. Precisely
similar is the method of procedure in history and philosophy,
though the methods of proof in these sciences are not
equally rigorous. Great historical delusions—such as the
Popish plot—are put to rest by showing the misinterpreted
facts out of which they have grown, exposing the misinterpretation,
and substituting true interpretation. Imperfect psychological
analysis, say of an emotion, is superseded by showing
from what facts this analysis has been obtained, and what other
facts it fails to account for.</p>

<p>Observe, then, that in all these cases the appeal is made from
the first impressions of the mistaken person to his own impressions
on further examination; not to those of another. Considerations
are laid before him which it is supposed will cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714"> 714</span>
him to change his mind, and in all that class of cases where
strict demonstration is possible actually do so. To a man who
believes the earth to be a flat extended surface we point out
the fact that the top of a ship's mast is the first part of it to
appear, and that this and other kindred phenomena imply
sphericity. Our appeal is from the senses to the senses better
informed; not from another man's senses to our own. And we
justly assume that were all the world in possession of the facts
we have before us, all the world would be of our opinion.</p>

<p>What, then, is the conclusion from these analogies? It
surely is, that those who would deny the reality of the object
of religious emotion must show from what appearances, misunderstood,
the belief in that object has arisen, and must point
out other appearances leading to other emotions which are in
conflict with it. As the astronomer appeals from sensible perception
to sensible perception, so they must appeal from emotion
to emotion. But it must not be their own emotions to
which they go as forming a standard for ours. They can
demand no hearing at all until they attempt to influence the
emotions of those whom they address.</p>

<p>Generality of belief need not, for the purposes of this argument,
be taken as even a presumption of truth. We can grant
our adversaries this advantage which, in the parallel cases of
the illusions of the senses, was neither asked nor given. But
we must ask them in return to concede to us that, if the generality
of a belief entitles it to no weight in philosophic estimation,
the singularity of a belief entitles it to none either. All
mankind may be deluded: well and good: <i>a fortiori</i> a few individuals
among mankind may be deluded too. Grant that the
human faculties at large are subject to error and deception, it
follows from this that the faculties of individuals lie under the
same disability. No word can be said as to the general liability
to false beliefs, which does not carry with it the liability to
false beliefs of the very persons who are seeking to convince us.</p>

<p>By whom, in fact, are we asked to admit, in the interests of
their peculiar theory, the prevalence of a universal deception,
and a deception embracing in its grasp not only the ignorant
multitude, but men of science, thinkers and philosophers of the
very highest altitude of culture? By whom is it that the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715"> 715</span>
mass of humankind is charged with baseless thoughts, illusory
emotions, and untenable ideas? By those who, in thus denying
the capacity of the whole human race to perceive the truth,
nevertheless maintain their own capacity to see over the heads of
their fellow men so far as to assert that they are all the victims
of an error. By those who, while bidding us distrust the strongest
feelings, nevertheless require us to trust them so far as to
banish, at their bidding, those feelings from our hearts. Not
from our reason to our more instructed reason do they appeal,
only from our reason to their own. But I deny the competence
of the tribunal; and I maintain that until not merely disbelief,
but disproof, of the position of Religion can be offered, Religion
must remain in possession of the field.</p>

<p>Yet there is one mistake which, as it may tend to obscure the
issue, it will be desirable to clear away. It is often contended,
oftener perhaps tacitly assumed, that the burden of proof must
rest on those who in any case maintain the affirmative side of
a belief, while the negative on its side requires no proof, but
can simply claim reception until the affirmative is established.
Now this principle is true, where the negative is simply a suspension
of judgment; the mere non-acceptance of a fact
asserted, without a counter-assertion of its opposite. To understand
the true application of the rule we must distinguish
between what I will term substantial affirmations or negations,
and affirmations or negations in form. Thus, to assert that A.
B. is six feet tall, is a substantial affirmation. Out of many possible
alternatives it selects one, and postulates that one as true,
while all the rest it discards as false. Since, however, there are
numerous possibilities besides this one with regard to A. B.'s
height—since he may be either taller or shorter by various
degrees—the negative, in the absence of all knowledge on the
subject, is inherently more probable, for it covers a larger
ground. It is a substantial negation. That is, it affirms nothing
at all, but simply questions the fact affirmed, leaving the
field open to countless other substantial affirmations. So, in
law, it is the prosecution which is required to prove its case;
for the prosecution affirms that this man was at a given place
at a given time and did the criminal action. The opposite
hypothesis of this covers innumerable alternatives: not this man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716"> 716</span>
but another, may have been at that place, or he may have been
there and not done the action charged, or some other man may
have done it, or the crime may have not been committed at all,
and so forth. These are cases of substantial affirmations; asserting
one alone out of many conceivable possibilities, and therefore
needing proof. And their opposites are substantial negations;
questioning only the one fact affirmed, and even with
reference to that merely maintaining that in the absence of
proof there is an inherent probability in favor of the negative
side.</p>

<p>Widely different is the case before us. Here the affirmation
and negation are affirmative and negative in form alone. The
assertions, "An Unknowable Being exists," and "An Unknowable
Being does not exist," are not opposed to one another as
the affirmative and the negative sides were opposed in the previous
cases. The latter proposition does not cover a number of
possible alternatives whereof the former selects and affirms a
single one. Both propositions are true and substantial affirmations.
Both assert a supposed actual fact. And the latter does
not, as the previous negative propositions did, leave the judgment
in simple suspense. It requires assent to a given doctrine.
That the one cast is in a negative form is the mere accident
of expression, and without in any way affecting their substance,
their positions in this respect may be reversed. Thus,
we may say for the first, "The universe cannot exist without an
Unknowable Being;" and for the second, "The universe can
exist without an Unknowable Being." There are not here a
multitude of alternatives, but two only, and of these each side
affirms one. Each proposition is equally the assertion of a positive
belief. Thus, the reason which, in general, causes the
greater antecedent probability of a denial as against a positive
assertion, in no way applies to the denial of the fundamental
postulate of Religion. The statement that there is nobody in a
certain room is not in itself more probable than the statement
that there is somebody. And the proposition: "all men are not
mortal," though negative in form, is truly as affirmative as the
counter-proposition: "all men are mortal."</p>

<p>But this argument, inasmuch as it places the denial of all
truth in the religious emotion on a level with its affirmation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717"> 717</span>
fails to do justice to the real strength of the case. There are
not here two contending beliefs, of which the one is as probable
as the other. In conceding so much to the skeptical party
we have given them a far greater advantage than they are entitled
to demand. Generality of belief is, in the absence of evidence
or argument to the contrary, a presumption of truth; for,
unless its origin from some kind of fallacy can be shown, its
generality is in itself a proof that it persists in virtue of the
general laws of mind which forbid the separation of its subject
from its predicate. And it is not only that we have here a general
belief, or, more correctly speaking, a general emotion, but
we have categories in the human mind which are not filled up
or capable of being filled up by the objective element in the
religious idea. There is, for example, the category of Cause;
Nature presents us not with Cause, but with causes; and these
causes are mere antecedents, physical causation in general being
nothing whatever but invariable antecedents and invariable
sequence. But this analysis of the facts of nature by no means
satisfies the conception of causation which is rooted in the
human mind. That conception imperiously demands a cause
which is not a mere antecedent, but a Power. Without that,
the idea would remain as a blank form, having no reality to fill
it. And how do we come to be in the firm possession of this
idea if there be nothing in nature corresponding to it? From
what phenomena could it be derived? Akin to our notion of
Cause is our notion of Force. When the scientific man speaks
of a Force, he merely means an unknown something which
effects certain movements. And Science cannot possibly dispense
with the metaphysical idea of Force. Yet Force is not
only unknowable; but it is <i>the</i> Unknowable manifested in certain
modes. Again, therefore, I ask, whence do we derive ineradicable
feeling of the manifestation of Force, if that feeling
be a mere illusion? Similar remarks apply to other categories
which, like these, have no objects in actual existence in the conformity
of the religious sentiment to truth be denied. Such is
the category of Reality. Imagination cannot picture the world
save as containing, though in its essence unknown to us, some
real and permanent being. We know it only as a compound of
phenomena, all of them fleeting, variable, and unsubstantial.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718"> 718</span>
There is nothing in the phenomena which can satisfy our mental
demand for absolute being. As being transient, and as being
relative, the phenomena in fact are nothing. But our intellectual,
our emotional, and our moral natures demand the τό ὃντως
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">ὄν—that which really is, as the necessary completion of</span><br />
τὰ φαινόμεα—that which only appears. And it is precisely
the unshakeable belief in an unchangeable, though unknowable
Reality; an everlasting Truth amid shifting forms, a Substance
among shadows, which forms the universal foundation of religious
faith.</p>

<p>A ship that has been driven from her intended course is
drifting, with a crew who have no clear knowledge of her whereabouts,
upon an unexplored ocean. Suddenly her captain exclaims
that he sees land in the distance. The mate, however,
summoned to verify the captain's observation, fancies that the
black speck on the horizon is not land, but a large vessel. The
sailors and passengers take part, some with the one, some with
the other; while many of them form opinions of their own not
agreeing with that of either, one maintaining it to be a whale,
another a dark cloud, a third something else, and so forth.
Minor differences abound. Those who take it to be land are at
issue as to its being a plain or a mountain, those who think it
a vessel cannot agree as to the description of the craft. One
solitary passenger sees nothing at all. Instead of drawing what
would appear to be the most obvious conclusion, that he is
either more shortsighted or less apt to discover distant objects
than the rest, he infers that his vision alone is right, and that
of all the others, captain, passengers, and crew, defective and
misleading. Oblivious of the fact that the mere failure to perceive
an object is no proof of its non-existence, he persists in
asserting not only that the speck seen in the distance, being so
variously described, probably does not resemble any of the
ideas formed of it on board the ship, but that there is no speck
at all. Even the fact that the crews of many other ships, passing
in this direction, perceive the same dim outline on the horizon,
does not shake his conviction that it is a mere "idol of
the tribe." Such is the procedure of those who deny the reality
of the object of the religious idea. Instead of drawing from the
diversity of creeds the legitimate inference that the Being of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719"> 719</span>
whom they severally speak is of unknown nature, they conclude,
from the mere absence of the idea of that Being in their individual
consciousness, that its very existence is a dream.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words, and a few only, must be said in reply
to those who will think that the cenception of the Unknowable
resulting from our analysis is too vague and shadowy to form
the fitting foundation for religious feeling. They will probably
object that the Being whom that feeling requires is not an inconceivable
Cause or Substance of the Universe, but a Personal
God; not an undefined something which we can barely imagine,
but a definite Some one whom we can adore and love. There
is nothing, they will say, in such a conception as this either to
satisfy the affections or to impress the moral sentiments. And
both purposes were fulfilled by the Christian ideal of a loving
Father and a righteous Judge.</p>

<p>To these objections I would reply, first of all, that I have
simply attempted to analyze religion as I found it, neither
omitting what was of the essence of the religious idea, nor inserting
what was not. If this analysis is in any respect defective,
that is a matter for criticism and discussion. But if it has
been correctly performed—of which I frankly admit there is
abundant room for doubt—then I am not responsible for not
finding in the universal elements of religion that which is not
contained within them. The expression found for the ultimate
truths must embrace within it, if possible, the crude notions of
deity formed by the savage, and the highly abstract ideal formed
by the most eminent thinkers of modern times. Even then, if
I myself held the doctrines of the personality and the fatherhood
of God, I could not have required from others any admission
of these views of mine as universal ingredients in religious
faith. The utmost I could have done would have been to tack
them on as supplementary developments of the idea of the
ultimate Being. And thus it is still open to any one who wishes
it to do. Difficult as it is to reconcile the ideas of Love and
Justice with unlimited Power and absolute Existence, yet if there
are some who find it possible to accomplish the reconciliation,
it may be well for them so to do.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_720"> 720</span>
Undoubtedly, however, all such efforts do appear to me mere
hankerings after an incarnation of that idea which, by its very
nature, does not admit of representation by incarnate forms,
even though those forms be moral perfections. And I would
reply, secondly, to the above objection, that, while we lose
something by giving up the definite personality of God, we gain
something also. If we part with the image of a loving Father,
we part also with that of a stern monarch and an implacable
judge. If we can no longer indulge in the contemplation of perfect
virtue, embodied in an actual Person, we are free from the
problem that has perplexed theologians of every age: how to
reconcile the undoubted evil in the world with the omnipotence
of that Person. I know that there are some who think it possible
to retain the gentler features in the popular conception of
deity, while dropping all that is harsh and repulsive. To them
the idea of God is as free from terror as the idea of the Unknowable,
and the first of these gains is therefore no gain to
them. But the problem of the existence of evil presses perhaps
with greater severity upon them than upon any other class of
theologians. To suppose that God could not prevent the presence
of wickedness, or could not prevent it without some greater
calamity, is to deny his omnipotence; to suppose that he could,
and did not, is to question his benevolence. But even admitting
the improvement made by purging from the character of God
all its severity, its vindictiveness, and its tendency to excessive
punishment, the fact remains that the conception thus attained
is not that of the popular creed at all, but that of a few enlightened
thinkers. And it is with the former, not with the latter,
that the doctrine of the Unknowable must be compared, in
order fairly to estimate its advantages or disadvantages in relation
to the current belief in a personal God.</p>

<p>Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the dim figure we
have shadowed out of an inconceivable and all-embracing ultimate
Existence, if widely different from the more ordinary theological
embodiments of the religious idea, is altogether in harmony
with many of its expressions by the most devoutly relig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721"> 721</span>ious
minds. If religion has always had a tendency to run to
seed in dogma, it has also always had a tendency to revert to
its fundamental mysticism. The very best and highest minds
have continually evinced this tendency to mysticism, and it has
mixed itself up with the logical definitions of others who did
not rise to so exalted a level. So that the examination of the
writings of religious men will continually disclose that profound
impression of the utterly incomprehensible and mysterious
nature of the Supreme Being which is now, in its complete development
in the form of Agnosticism, stigmatized as incompatible
with genuine religious faith.</p>

<p>That tendency to be deeply sensible of the impossibility of
conceiving the Absolute which Religion has thus evinced, it is
the result of Science to strengthen and to increase. Science
shows the imperfection of all the concrete expressions which
have been found for the Unknowable. It proves that we cannot
think of the Unknowable as entering in any peculiar sense
into special objects in nature, dwelling in special places, or
speaking through special channels. Miraculous phenomena,
which were supposed to constitute the peculiar sphere of its
manifestations, are thrown by Science completely out of the
account. But all phenomena whatsoever are shown to manifest
the Unknowable. Thus, while scientific inquiry tends to diminish
the intensity of religious ideas, it tends to widen their
extension. They do not any longer cling to partial symbols.
They do not attach themselves with the same fervor to individual
embodiments. But, in becoming more abstract, they
become also more pervading. Religion is found everywhere and
in everything. All nature is the utterance of the idea. And, as
it gains in extension while losing in intensity in reference to
the external world, it goes through a similar process in relation
to human life. No longer a force seizing on given moments of
our existence, at one moment inspiring devotional observances,
at the next forgotten in the pleasures or the business of the
day; at one time filling men with the zeal of martyrs or crusaders,
at another leaving them to the unrestrained indulgence
of gross injustice or revolting cruelty, it becomes a calm, all-pervading
sentiment, shown (if it be shown at all) in the general
beauty and spirituality of the character, not in the stated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722"> 722</span>
exercises of a rigorous piety, or in the passionate outbursts of
an enthusiastic fervor.</p>

<p>But these considerations would lead me on to a subject
which I had once hoped to treat within the boundaries of the
present volume, but which I am now compelled, owing to the
enlargement of the scheme, to postpone to a future time. That
subject is the relation of religion to ethics. It may have
struck some readers as an omission that I have said nothing of
religion as a force inspiring moral conduct, which is the principal
aspect under which it is regarded by some competent
authorities. But the omission has been altogether intentional.
It would take me a long time to explain what in my judgment
has been the actual influence of religion upon morals in the
past, and what is likely to be its influence in the future. Meanwhile
I merely note the fact that this analysis professes to be
complete in its own kind; that I have endeavored to probe the
religious sentiment to the bottom, and to discover all that it
contains. Thus, if religion be not only an emotion, but a
moral force, it must acquire this character in virtue of the relation
of its emotional elements to human character, not in virtue
of the presence of ethical elements actually belonging to the
religious emotion, and comprehended under it by the same indefeasible
title as the sense of the Unknowable itself.</p>

<p>At present, however, I can attempt no answer to the objection
which will no doubt be urged, that so abstract and cold a
faith as that expounded here can afford no satisfaction to the
moral sentiments. Indeed I must to a certain extent admit the
reality of the loss which the adoption of this faith entails.
There is consolation no doubt in the thought of a Heavenly
Father who loves us; there is strength in the idea that he sees
and helps us in our continual combat against evil without and
evil within; there is happiness in the hope that he will assign
us in another life an infinite reward for all the endurances of
this. Above all, there is comfort in the reflection that when we
are parted by death we are not parted for ever; that our love
for those whom we have cherished on earth is no temporary
bond, to be broken ere long in bitterness and despair, but a
possession never to be lost again, a union of souls interrupted
for a little while by the separation of the body, only to be again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723"> 723</span>
renewed in far greater perfection and carried on into far higher
joys than can be even imagined here. All this is beautiful and
full of fascination: why should we deny it? Candor compels
us to admit that in giving it up with the other illusions of our
younger days we are resigning a balm for the wounded spirit
for which it would be hard to find an equivalent in all the
repertories in Science, and in all the treasures of philosophy.
Yet it must be borne in mind that every step from a lower to
a higher creed involves a precisely similar loss. How much
more beautiful was nature (as Schiller has shown us in his poem
on the gods of Greece) when every fountain, tree and river had
its presiding genius, when the Sun was driven by a divine
charioteer, when the deities of Olympus intervened in the affairs
of men to prevent injustice and to maintain the right. How
cold and lifeless, nay, how profoundly irreligious, would our
modern conception of the earth and the solar system have
appeared to the worshiper of Poseidon and Apollon. And if the
loss of the Christian as compared to the Pagan is thus great,
how great also is the loss of the enlightened Protestant as compared
to the ignorant Catholic peasant. What comfort must be
found in the immediate intervention of the Virgin in answer to
prayer, what security afforded by the protection of the local
saint. Or again, how great the pleasure of contributing by our
piety to the release of a friend from purgatorial torment, and
of knowing that our friends will do us the same kindly service.</p>

<p>Even without contrasting such broad and conspicuous divisions
of Christianity as these, we shall find enough of the same
kind of difference within the limits of Protestantism itself.
What mere intellectual conviction of a future state can vie with
the consoling certainty offered by the Spiritualistic belief, that
those whom we have lost on earth still hover around us in our
daily course; sometimes even appear to us in bodily form, and
converse with us in human speech. No mere hope of meeting
them again can for a moment equal the delight of seeing their
well-known shapes and hearing their familiar tones. Hence the
Spiritualist has undoubtedly a source of comfort in his faith
which more rational creeds can offer nothing to supply. But
who that does not share it can envy them so baseless a conviction,
so illusory a joy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_724"> 724</span></p>

<p>It is, in fact, the very condition of progress that, as we advance
in knowledge and in culture, we give up something on
the road. But it is also a condition that we do not feel the
need of that which we have lost. Not only as we become men
do we put away childish things, but we can no longer realize in
thought the enjoyment which those childish things brought
with them. Other interests, new occupations, deeper affections
take the place of the interests, the occupations, and the affections
of our early years. So too should it be in religion. Men
have dwelt upon the love of God because they could not satisfy
the craving of nature for the love of their fellow men. They
have looked forward to eternal happiness in a future life because
they could not find temporary happiness in this. It is these
reflections which point out the way in which the void left by
the removal of the religious affections should hereafter be supplied.
The effort of those who cannot turn for consolation to a
friend in heaven should be to strengthen the bonds of friendship
on earth, to widen the range of human sympathy and to
increase its depth. We should seek that love in one another
which we have hitherto been required to seek in God. Above
all, we should sweep away those barriers of convention and
fancied propriety which continually hinder the free expression
of affection, and force us to turn from the restrictions of the
world to One towards whom there need be no irksome conformity
to artificial regulation, and in speaking to whom we are
under no shadow of reserve.</p>

<p>Were we thus permitted to find in our fellow creatures that
sympathy which so many mourners, so many sufferers, so many
lonely hearts, have been compelled to find only in the idea of their
heavenly Father, I hesitate not to say that the consolations of the
new religion would far surpass in their strength and their perfection
all those that were offered by the old. Towards such increasing
and such deepening of the sympathies of humanity I believe
that we are continually tending even now. Meantime, while we
are still far from the promised land, the adherents of the universal
religion are not without a happiness of their own. Their
faith is at least a faith of perfect peace. Untroubled by the
storms of controversy, in which so many others are tossed about,
they can welcome all men as brothers in faith, for all of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725"> 725</span>
even the most hostile, contribute to supply the stones of the
broad foundation upon which their philosophy is built. Those
therefore who contend against them, be it even with vehemence
and passion, yield, them involuntary help in bringing the materials
upon which their judgment is formed. No man can truly
oppose their religion, for he who seems to be hostile to it is
himself but one of the notes struck by the Unknowable Cause,
which so plays upon the vast instrument of humanity as to
bring harmony out of jangling sounds, and to produce the universal
chords of truth from the individual discords of error.
Scientific discoveries and philosophic inquiries, so fatal to other
creeds, touch not the universal religion. They who accept it
can but desire the increase of knowledge, for even though new
facts and deeper reasoning should overthrow something of what
they have hitherto believed and taught, they will rejoice that
their mistakes should be corrected, and their imperfections
brought to light. They desire but the Truth, and the Truth has
made them free. And as in their thoughts they can wish nothing
so much as to know and to believe that which is true, so
in their lives they will express the serenity which that desire will
inevitably bring. They are not pained or troubled because other
men see not as they see. They have no vain hope of a unity of
thought which the very conditions of our being do not permit.
They aim not at conquering the minds of men; far rather
would they stimulate and help them to discover a higher Truth
than they themselves have been permitted to know. And as
their action will thus be inspired with hope of contributing
their mite to the treasury of human knowledge, well-being, and
moral good, so their death will be the expression of that, peaceful
faith which has sustained their lives. Even though torn
away when, in their own judgment, they have still much to do,
they will not repine at the necessity of leaving it undone, even
though they are well aware that their names, which might have
been illustrious in the annals of our race, will now be buried in
oblivion. For the disappearance of a single life is but a ripple
on the ocean of humanity, and humanity feels it not. Hence
they will meet their end "sustained and soothed by an unfaltering
trust,"</p>

<p>But the opposite fate, sometimes still more terrible, that of
continuing to live when the joys of life are gone, and its purest
happiness is turned into the bitterest pain, will be accepted too.
Thus they will be willing, it need be, to remain in a world where
their labor is not yet ended, even though that labor be wrought
through suffering, despondency, and sorrow; willing also, if
need be, to meet the universal lot—even though it strike them
in the midst of prosperity, happiness, and hope; bowing in
either case to the verdict of fate with unmurmuring resignation
and fearless calm.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> After some hesitation, I have determined to adhere to the Latinized
form of the name of the prophet of China, as more familiar to English
ears. As a general rule, I consider the movement in literature which is
restoring proper names to their original spellings,—giving us Herakles
for Hercules, and Oidipous for Œdipus,—as deserving of all support. But
where the common form, in addition to being the more familiar, may be
considered as English proper and not Latin used in English (as in such
names as Homer, Aristotle, Jesus Christ), I conceive it to be more convenient
to retain the accustomed designation, even though it may be regretted
that it has come into general use. Hence, I think, we may retain Confucius,
who would scarcely be recognized by English readers under his full name,
Khung-fu-tsze, or under his more usual abridged name, Khung-tsze, or
under the name elsewhere given him, Chung-ne. No similar justification
appears to me to exist for the Greek form Zoroaster, as compared with
Zarathustra, which last form is as easy to pronounce as the other, and not
very dissimilar from it in sound.</p>

<p>My authorities for the life of Confucius have been Dr. Legge's Chinese
Classics, vol. i. Proleg. p. 54-113, and the Lun Yu and Chung Yung, translated

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> In treating of the Sacred Books of the Confucian School in China, I
rely entirely upon the admirable and (so far as it has yet gone) complete
work of the Rev. Dr. James Legge. Although I have consulted other publications,
I have not drawn my information from them, because it was at
once evident that Dr. Legge's "Chinese Classics" was immeasurably
superior to all that had preceded it on the same subject. Unfortunately,
the very thoroughness of the work renders it voluminous; and it thus
happens that the author has not fulfilled more than a portion of the
promise held out at its commencement. It must be the earnest hope of
all who are interested in these studies that the learned missionary will
live to complete his design; meantime, we are obliged to confine ourselves
to a notice of that portion of the Classics which he has translated. For
Pauthier's French translation of the Chinese Classics (in the Panthéon
Littéraire: "Les Livres Sacrés de l'Orient") embraces only that portion of
the King which is to be found in the hitherto-published volumes of Dr.
Legge.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> By far the best European work on the Taò-tĕ-Kīng is that of Victor
von Strauss, and I have followed his translation, though not without consulting
those of others. I am fully sensible of the inconvenience of a
double translation, and I should have preferred to follow Chalmers' English
rendering of Laò-tsé, had not the obscurity of his version been so
great as to render it almost unintelligible to the general reader. Reinhold
von Plänckner's translation errs on the other side by excess of clearness.
It is a palpable attempt to force upon the ancient Chinaman a connected
system professedly unraveled from the text by the ingenuity of the modern
German. It should be used only with extreme caution, or not at all.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> It deserves to be noted, as a peculiarity of the Chinese prophets—Confucius
and Laò-tsé—that they alone among their peers have left
authentic written compositions. The Koran can scarcely be said to have
been written by Mahomet, in the sense in which we talk of writing a book.
And neither Zarathustra, Jesus, nor the Buddha, were authors. The
calmer Chinese temperament permitted, in the case of these two great
teachers, a mode of conveying instructions which is repugnant, as a rule,
to the fervid prophetic nature. Observe that of the Jewish (so-called)
prophets, those who committed their prophecies to writing, generally
belonged to a comparatively late age, in which oral prophecy was no
longer in vogue, and the state of feeling that had inspired it no longer
prevalent.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> The literature of the Veda is now copious. To mention only a few
works, H. H. Wilson published a translation of the first five Ashtakas of
the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ, but I have forborne to make use of it, from a conviction
that the advance of Vedic scholarship has to a great degree, if not
wholly, superseded the methods of interpretation employed by him. Benfey
has translated the whole of the Sâma-Veda-Sanhitâ into German, and I
have studied his translation, but have preferred to rely mainly on the
labors of English scholars, both because the inherent obscurity of these
ancient hymns might be increased by the process of re-translation, and
also because I might possibly fail to catch the exact shade of meaning of
the German words. His work should, however, be consulted by those who
desire to acquaint themselves with the style of the Veda. Max Müller has
unhappily published but one volume of his translation of the Rig-Veda-Sanhitâ,
which is doubtless destined (if completed) to become the standard
English version of that portion of the text. The same eminent scholar has
translated many of the hymns in his "Ancient Sanskrit Literature."
Another source from which I have derived valuable assistance is Dr.
Muir's laborious work entitled "Original Sanskrit Texts." Such are the
principal authorities on the hymns. Of the Brâhmanas, the whole of the
Aitareya Brâhmana has been translated by Haug, and portions of others
by Roer and by Rajendralal Mitra.</p>

But complete treatises, or portions of treatises, have been translated by
Burnouf, in his "Histoire du Buddhisme Indien," and "Lotus de la Bonne
Loi;" by Beal, in his "Chinese Buddhist Scriptures;" by Schmidt, in "Der
Weise und der Thor;" by Hardy, in his "Manual of Buddhism," and by
Alabaster, in his "Modern Buddhist." An exact analysis of the contents of the
hundred volumes of the great collection called the Kah-gyur is supplied by
Csoma Kőrösi in the 20th vol. of the "Asiatic Researches." The leading features
of the books, and parts of books thus translated, are so well marked and uniform,
that nothing further is needed to enable us to estimate the general
character of each division of the whole Tripitaka.</p>

of the Buddha used to attain; <i>i. e.</i>, the one which led most directly to Nirvâna.
The other three degrees were those of Srotâpatti, of Sakridâgâmin, and Anâgâmin.
The Arhat was not born again; each of the other three had a
smaller or greater number of existences to undergo before Nirvâna.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> The authorities do not entirely agree in the accounts they give of the
speed with which these paths lead to Nirvâna. The above statement appears
to me unquestionably the oldest and most authentic. It is in agreement with
Eitel, Sanskrit-Chinese Dictionary, <i>sub vocibus</i> Sakridâgâmin, however, is
omitted, and with Hardy, E. M., p. 280.</p>

<p>Eitel indeed adds that an Arhat, if he does not enter Nirvâna, may become
a Buddha, but this is probably a Northern perversion of the original notion.
In the genuine authorities, a Bodhisattva is quite distinct from an Arhat.
The account derived by Burnouf (H. B. I., p. 291 ff.) from Northern sources is
palpably a corruption of the oldest doctrine, proceeding from that unbounded
love of exaggerated numbers which is the besetting sin of Buddhist writers.
According to this version, the Srotâpanna must pass through 80,000 ages before
his seven births; Sakridâgâmin, after 60,000 ages, is to be born once
as a man and once as a god; the Anâgâmin, after 40,000 ages, is exempted from
re-birth in the world of desire, and arrives at supreme knowledge; which the
Arhat reaches after 20,000 ages. Poor comfort this to souls longing for their
eternal rest. Cf. Köppen, R. B., vol. i. p. 498.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[70]</a> There is a complete translation of the Zend-Avesta by Spiegel. It contains
useful introductory essays; but in the present state of Zend scholarship
the translation cannot be regarded as final. Dr. Haug, in a German
treatise, has elucidated as well as translated a small, but very important,
portion, of the Zend-Avesta, termed the five Gâthâs. The same scholar has
also published a volume of Essays on the Parsee language and religion,
which contains some translated passages, and may be consulted with advantage,
though Dr. Haug's English stands in great need of revision. Burnouf
has translated but a very small part of the Zend-Avesta, in a work entitled
"Le Yaçna." Unfortunately Dr. Haug and Dr. Spiegel—both very eminent
Zend scholars—are entirely at variance as to the proper method of translating
these ancient documents; and pending the settlement of this question,
any interpretation proposed must be regarded by the uninstructed reader as
uncertain. I cannot refrain from adding an expression of regret that Dr.
Haug, to whose labors in the interpretation of these obscure fragments of
antiquity we owe so much, should have so far forgotten himself as to fall foul
of Dr. Spiegel in a tone wholly unbecoming a scholar and inappropriate to
the subject. It is not by this kind of learned Billingsgate that the superiority
of his translation to that of his rival, as he evidently considers him, or his
fellow-laborer as I should prefer to call him, can be established.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> Throughout the Gâthâs I follow Haug; and I need make no apology
for neglecting Spiegel's translation, because that scholar himself admits,
with creditable candor, that even his indefatigable perseverance was
baffled by the difficulties of this portion of the Yaçna.—Av., 2. xi.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> The sentences enclosed in parentheses are Haug's explanations of the
sense of the text.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> It is a satisfaction to find that Spiegel's translation does not differ so
widely from Haug's after we leave the territory of the Gâthâs. As a specimen,
I quote the following verses from his Avesta, vol. ii. p. 135, which the
reader may compare with the English rendering of the same passage in the
text:—</p>

<p><i>Yaçna Haptağhâiti.</i></p>

<p>xxxv. 1.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. "(Raçpi). Den Ahura-Mazda, den reinen Herrn des Reinen, preisen
wir. Die Amesha-çpenta, die guten Herrscher, die weisen, preisen wir. 2.
Die ganze Welt des Reinen preisen wir, die himmlische wie die irdische, 3.
mit Verlangen nach der guten Reinheit, mit Verlangen nach dem guten mazdayaçnischen
Gesetze. 4. (Zaota.) Der guten Gedanken, Worte und Werke,
die hier und anderswo 5. gethan worden sind oder noch gethan werden, 6.
Lobpreiser und Verbreiter sind wir, damit wir zu den Guten gehören mögen.
7. Das glauben wir, Ahura-Mazda, Reiner, Schöner, 8. Das wollen wir

Menschen für beide Welten. 10. Durch diese besten Thaten nun erbitten wir, dass
für das Vieh 11. Annehmlichkeit und Futter gespendet werden möge 12. den
Gelehrten wie den Ungelehrten, den Mächtigen wie den Unmächtigen."</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
